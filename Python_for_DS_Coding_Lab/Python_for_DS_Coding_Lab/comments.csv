"Strongly encouraging sign for us.  The T-Wolves management better not screw this up and they better surround Wiggins with a championship caliber team to support his superstar potential or else I wouldn't want him to sour his prime years here in Minnesota just like how I felt with Garnett.

TL;DR: Wolves better not fuck this up."

A.) Flip trades down for him if we get the #3 or #4 pick?
B.) Is his game similar to KG his rookie year? Do you think there is a mentorship in the making? Im not that familiar with KGs playstyle in his rookie years so I could be wrong."

"We hope so too, Ender.  We hope so too."
"Great reply. I think the main concern with Porzingis is how thin he is. If he can bulk up and keep his PF quickness, he can be a great NBA player, imho. But I think he will never be better than the top 3 picks (KAT, Okafor, Mudiay), and Russell and Winslow are more NBA ready, too. A 6th pick for Porzingis seems right for me."

The media, the media. They never disappoint."
"Yupiii!!!!!! Great Wiggins celebration!!!!! =D

Though, I disagree with the abysmal difference in 1st place votes he and the rest received. I think the competition was really close between Mirotic and especially Noel, and that they deserved much more votes. Even if Mirotic already was one of the best professional players in Europe -- and because of this he had a different role -- he's still really young and contributed a lot. And Noel, he was amazing too.

But Wiggins upvote party! =D"

"Wiggins on the level of KG?!"
"I'm comfortable with saying that Wiggins is as good as KG if we're controlling for them being at the same stage in their career.  AKA rookie Wiggins = rookie KG or even slightly better.

No way is rookie Wiggins the equivalent to prime KG though.  I don't think anybody would even bother with that argument."
"Understand the premise, but I actually think Flip is a very good GM.  I just hope we don't KAAAAHN it."
"Actually a lot better than KG was at 19. Obviously he's not guaranteed to have the same type of career."
"You also wouldn't draft Okafor top 2 so its hard to take you seriously. "
"Porzingis just sounds like that guy nobody wants us to draft, but we will end up with him anyway. "
"You're right, but you and I have already discussed that in another thread. Agree to disagree on Okafor? "

"Not as much as you'd think.

Trenton fuckin Hassel started on that team.

That team is a testament to just how absurdly dominant KG was in his prime."

"I wanna cop a pair of these and sell em for millions when he's a star. "
"They seem so Wiggins. Did he help design them?"
"The more I think about this the more I can understand Flip's rational for liking Porzingis. A stretch big man certainly opens more space for Wiggins and Muhammad to operate. He would be a solid fit on the Wolves provided he gets stronger in order to operate on defense and be a better rebounder. If the Wolves draft him plus grab Amir Johnson in free agency to provide a versatile interior presence the Wolves could operate well synergistic wise. Kristaps certainly fits better than the potential alternatives in Mudiaye, Russell, even Winslow and Okafor. It's a gamble but I can buy into that rational. Flip's perceived interest in Porzingis certainly makes more sense fit wise than Flip's perceived love of Okafor at #1, who in my opinion has no fit on the Wolves and brings quite a bit of problems roster construction wise. "
"I dig these a lot. Like the AW logo too with the maple leaf. Hopefully this signifies a potential Wiggins signature shoe in the summer. Going to be really cool when we start seeing kids across the state try to emulate Wiggins and potentially spark a growth of future Minnesota NBA ballers. "

"taking kp over russell at #3 would be simply awful."
"Less of a Wiggins article more of a discussion on the discrepancy of the different types of basketball analysis. Paine even went into why Wiggins looks so bad in the advance metrics (his teammates sucked this year). The other reason, and this is purely in my own understanding, is that Wiggins doesn't do anything else beside score that shows up in the stats column. He is a poor passer and an outright terrible rebounder. Work there would go along way in him contributing way more positively on the court and within the advance metrics.  

Unfortunately anything less than messiah praise of Wiggins or the other young Wolves is met with outright disdain. "
"Hey OP, you should x-post this to /r/basketballdunks !!!

:)"
"Good idea! Thanks!"
"Disagree, KG was way more well rounded at 19 than Wiggins is. The only plus Wiggins has is he is a better scorer and even that is debatable based on their roles on their respective teams during their rookie seasons. "
"Yeah my comment came out pretty douchy. Sorry about that. "
"It's all good. In the end we're both Twolves fans so we're good. "
"Same fish who called Andrew the next James Posey."
"Ya the analytic models that guy made from canius hoopus hated lavine coming into the draft, but they also hated Shabazz, and weren't too high on wiggins. I've done some similar analysis on my own and statistic models hated lavine (his college stats just weren't that good) but the models weren't actually that good at predicting performance and were only marginally better than just going by where that were drafted. The thing I noticed from the models were that they loved low ceiling players with good college stats, which is the total opposite of lavine and wiggins. But the things lavine did have going for him was his age and athleticism. The best model I could come up with used the scouting grades from nbadraft.net along with college stats and combine measurables, and the most important predictor of NBA success was age, folllowed by steals and rebounding, and athleticism grades from scouting reports."
"its because the young guys are literally the only thing we have going for us as a franchise. honest critical analysis of them means confronting the possibility that we don't even have that. people don't want to ask those types of questions. can't ignore them forever though"
"Maybe someday a kid from Minnesota could lead duke to a championship title in his freshman year.  Lead all scorers with 23 points.   You just never know."

"These predictor stats are interesting to me.  They are made to predict and use statistical tendencies.  It tough to account for everything in these models.  You cant add in the intangibles, and im not sure how they would account for athleticism either.  I trust my eyes more and my eyes say Lavine could become one hell of a player.   "
"We're so due for a rebrand and new logo. Still, cool court."
"Even at the end of the season he was horrid on defense, took terrible shots on offense, and turned the ball over like it was his job to give the ball to the defense. Just run through the article the things he was good at he rarely did and the things he is terrible at he did often. "
"I like it! I wish our courts wood was one solid color like this."
"the court itself is much better than target center currently, the sideline is not good"
"&gt; no diference between inside the 3 point line and outside (as it is right now)

That's why I like it.  That change is abrasive on the eyes, ugly, and unlike any court that I've ever played on.

"Okafor is a 19 year old 7 footer with incredible finesse and body control. I would assume that's where he sees the comparison. Sure, Okafor is a minus D, but he's also a 19 year old 7 footer with incredible finesse and body control. He could very easily become a solid defender with proper training and coaching. "
"I like the black because Brooklyn's court is sleek af and nice. If we had better colors we could use them but the blue isn't really nice."
"Swap the primary logo at center court with the secondary logos on this one and I would be more than happy with that court."
"What's with the hate on this article and its author?  Paine isn't saying anything bad about Wiggins other than listing some objective stats.  He's actually praising him (in a roundabout way).

Wiggins improved massively throughout the year, and is probably going to be a great player very soon.  I think he's a top-20 asset in the league.  But this year overall, he wasn't good in the sense of helping us win more games.  I guarantee we would have had a better record starting an experienced SF with limited upside, like Ariza, Dunleavy, or Barnes.  And that's what the advanced metrics are intending to measure.

Paine's point is that advanced metrics struggle to measure how valuable top scorers are, especially when they're on bad teams.  In other words, that the objective stats (which are bad for Wiggins) are not indicative of how good he actually is."
"You can definitely see the confidence building! How did someone actually find all of these clips?"
"I don't get the hate for this article. He says that advanced metrics are not yet capable of predicting a players value going forward. He said that usage rate was just as important as these other factors in a players eventual ability, and that scorers like Wiggins look worse than they are by these advanced stats because they shoulder so much responsibility. This is good news for wolves fans."
"The current one sucks ass tho"
"That's the problem for me. It just looks like Brooklyn's court."
"The howling wolf right? I love that logo, pays homage to the original logo while still maintaining a new look. I really hope it becomes our primary logo. Plus whenever we play on ESPN they 3D the logo and that would look much better than the dogshit our current logo turns out to be. "
"The NFL just gave up it's tax exemption as a PR move; as it turns out, it doesn't affect their fiscal bottom line all that much. 

It's important to remember that it was just the NFL *headquarters* that was tax exempt. The teams are basically corporations; the NFL is sort of like a federation of corporations. Bottom line is that in a practical sense, the NFL is taxed just as much as it should be with how much revenue is generated.

Saying ""the NFL is tax exempt"" and drawing any criticism from that is misleading.

"Bro,Bjelica is phenomenous,T-wolves should definitely get him. Dubljevic is from my country,and I remember,5 or 6 years ago when he was still a kid,there was this game between Lovcen and Buducnost. Buducnost is biggest club in the country,has never lost a game in the championship(Nik Vucevic from Orlando played there),so Dubljevic basically played all by himself against Buducnost,making double double,but Lovcen lost in the end,because guys from the Buducnost hurt him. I believe you don't find this interesting,but I remember  him from back then,and have always knew he was going to became NBA potential."

With the west set to crumble soon-Barring injuries/off court bull shit-Wolves should be a top team in the league from like 2018-2023. I only hope a name change or radical uni alteration happens before then. I honestly hate watching you guys right now because the unis and court are so ugly."

Also, NO MORE SLEEVED JERSEYS. They are wasting the black alternate games!"

"Do you think he can help the development of KAT or Okafor?"
"Maybe. He could do it without being a player too probably "
"Definitely ceremonial more than anything. Brought in to be groomed for an eventual ownership takeover. I'd probably say Garnett's injuries were legit since he's 40 years old and his knees are probably shot. Pretty sure the Wolves have already made it known they're bringing him back as a player and hopefully the mentorship he'll provide is worth it. "
"1.  Although playing limited minutes, Garnett still looked pretty solid when he was on the court, anchoring the defense getting blocks, and making his midrange jumpers.


2. If he didnt plan on playing next year he would played in that last home game."
"he did, he was by far our best defensive player"
"Dude, you've become ""that guy"" when it comes to hating LaVine"
"If he's playing 14 minutes a game as a defensive anchor, how does that not help us?  He's a great 4th/5th big any way you cut it.

You make no sense."
"Nothing against LaVine as a dude, he's just not an NBA player. Plus you're sort of responsible for making me that guy. Since you know even when I've written comments off topic of LaVine you've brought him up to me.   

Maybe I'll change my tune if there was any evidence that LaVine is good but there isn't. "
"How many games can he play 14 mins in? Yeah he did play well in his brief stint this season but not enough to really give him a roster spot. If his real value is as a mentor it would make sense to give him a coaching job and not waste a precious roster spot on a guy that isn't going to play in a quarter of the total games for a season. "
"Ah, I forgot, no Mexico City game this year."
"&gt;How many games can he play 14 mins in?

Probably as many as Pek, or Bennett, or Rubio, or Shabazz, or Martin...?"
"Really? KG only played in 5 games total for the Wolves this season, no way is Garnett going to play in as many games as any of the guys you listed. "
"It depends on the contract he ends up signing. I quite like having him around. But not if there is a $10 million contract tied to him, I'd rather them pay him that to coach so it doesn't eat into the cap, on the off chance we could nab a young free agent that might actually work towards the future."
"Agreed. I have no clue why /u/Samurai_zero is acting like not having the different colors is a problem. Most teams don't have different colored wood like that, and ours looks terrible. The three-point line is there for a reason, you don't need to change the color of the wood to see what's three points and what's not.

(As an aside, the Clippers court does have different colors, but they're only a little different, and I actually think it looks pretty good.)"
"Garnett played in 47 games. That's more than anyone I listed, besides Bennett. "
"He only played in 5 games as a Timberwolves, the only team that matters in this discussion. You really think KG is going to play more than any of the guys you listed this upcoming season? He's old and his knees are absolutely fucked."
"Why would only the Timberwolves game matter? I can't even fathom what's going through your head. If Garnett were on the Timberwolves the whole season, he would have played 47 games, which is more than Rubio, Pekovic, Shabazz, or Martin played. "
"Based on 4.5 games? ugh"
"The evidence of how wrong you are was on the court (we were 1-4) and in the fact that he did not not play the last 21 games. He's (a) not that good anymore and (b) physically unable to play an NBA season"
"there's absolutely no way you can look at KG's time with us this season and say his acquisition was anything but ceremonial. the guy played 98 minutes total..."
"Eh, not for the NBA in my opinion. "
"If stat nerds gave out ROY, they wouldn't have used BPM they'd have used RAPM.

If they were good stat nerds, they'd understand the difference in value between being a #1 scorer without an NBA caliber PG (and how that effects your scoring efficiency) and being a #3 scorer like Mirotic on a team full of good passers.

Stat nerds understand the efficiency relative to creating your own shot vs being in a good system

And while I love that Mirotic became a very solid rotation player on a playoff team in the east, I don't think that makes up the difference between him and Wiggins who carried our offense half the time he was out there.  Of course that last part is something stat nerds wouldn't see."
"We're discussing KG's game total next season. Post trade deadline he played 5 games and 98 minutes total. Who really gives a shit about how many more games other Wolves players played that's not the topic of duscussion. Yeah KG played more games total last season than guys that were injured but it has very little relevance than the discussion at hand. Rubio, Shabazz, Martin, hell even Pek realistically are going to be playing more games than KG next season. They're younger and less ravaged injury wise than KG. "
"The team was 1-4. What was the difference when KG was on the court vs when KG was on the bench.

Hint: +18.9 points per 100 possessions.  
http://www.82games.com/1415/14MIN19.HTM#onoff

In Brooklyn it was a more moderate +2.2.

Team record isn't individual performance."
"Agreed. Obviously we don't want to pay our 4th/5th big $10 mil a year. But KG will likely have a better +/- or RAPM or however you want to measure court impact/team performance when he's on the court than anyone else.

Per minute played KG is still a good NBA player. You just aren't getting more than 20 minutes a night.  If he's doing that for $3-4 mil I think that's a solid value for us.  Big man coach on the floor, solid bench player (whether he starts or not)."
"What exactly can you anchor with this:

Stat | On Court | Off Court | Net
----|--------|---------|---
Minutes | 97 | 3862 | 2%
"
"KGs games in Brooklyn don't matter?  He played 20.3 minutes a game this season over 47 games. I'd guess at 14 minutes a game KG could play 60, but let's just say 15 minutes over 50 games. If we pay him $3-4 mil a year to be a big off the bench and big-man/defensive coach on the floor I think he's easily worth his salary."
"He played 47 games at 20.3 minutes a game last year. He was a solid starter all year in limited minutes, not just in Minnesota. I'm sorry you're not smart enough to understand that."
"Fuck off with the pathetic ad hominems, guy. It's pathetic that you're either (a) so riled up that youre throwing that shit around or (b) such a sorry person that this is normal behavior from you.

&gt;Solid starter all year

&gt;47 games

Pick one"
"Not really when he played a total of 5 games post trade. No way is he going to play 50 games even if you cut his minutes down. We'll be lucky to get 30 games out of him. Would serve better as a coach and not be occupying a roster spot. "
"How does cutting his minutes from 20 to 15 or 14 make him play fewer games?

I'm baffled."
"Don't be:  
A) Blatantly stupid.  
B) Arrogant at the same time.  
C) A whiney hypocrite.  
D) All of the above.  

Come on Lager17. You can get this one. I believe in you."
"His knees are absolutely fucked, cutting his minutes isn't going to mean he is going to be available more games. "
"You're projecting and you're coming back with more ad hominem garbage because you said that he was 

&gt;a solid starter all year

&gt;for 47 games

and your shitty math doesn't check out.

Tell me more about how questioning his ability to stay on the court and contribute is stupid, arrogant or whiney. In my pool of evidence I have REALITY. In yours you have a hypothetical salary, hypothetical minutes he might play, and a completely hypothetical metric for what he can do for the team in the limited minutes he does play.  "
"Lol me too. Although I don't know if it's quite right."
"Don't bother with this one, /u/FlyingScissor ..../u/unsmurfme has a fantasy scenario in his head that he believes in fervently, reality just isn't going to enter his thought process here.

I'm glad you're here though FS, it is reassuring that not everyone here is drinking nostalgia koolaid"
"Pssst, you projected his playing time first."
"I meant the other kind of projecting. You know, where you're attributing your shitty attitude here to me."
"[deleted]"
"I think the better conclusion is he's not a starting NBA PG, which makes perfect sense since he was a raw backup SG in college and was drafted on potential with the understanding it'd take a couple years for him to develop. He did in fact play awful for a starting PG. As a rookie. Learning the position on the fly.  I mean, duh.

Most people who think LaVine can become an allstar think he's going to be a below average ""player"" next year as well. But by the end of next year the hope is he'll begin to become an above average player and continue to improve over the next few years until he's an allstar.

I think his improvement from the start of the year to the end of the year was actually much better than expected, and he's a more exciting player to me because of that improvement. I can now imagine him as a good starting SG and emergency/3rd PG of the future in the NBA.

$0.02"
"Can you point me toward any of the supposed improvements. His efficiency numbers across the board remained constant throughout the season. The only changes is raw numbers because of the increase in total minutes at the end of the season. Even based on the eye test to me he was who he was at the beginning of the season and what he was in college. All-Star is a huge stretch for me to believe. At best I could see a decent 6th man, his game just isn't suited toward efficiency over everything that the contemporary NBA game is heading. "
"Logo/branding, yes. Jerseys are an abomination. It looks like the 80s pooped out a space-age style basketball jersey."
"Maybe ceremonial isn't the right word, but Hunter is expected to be a major day to day contributor and still rack up decent numbers. Garnett, even before the injuries was only going to be a 15-20 minutes a night guy."
"why not? too hip?"
"Well I mean those sold out games when the team itself is the worst team in league pretty much answers that question."
"Number 2 is important, no way in hell KG goes out quietly."
"He sold some tickets, lost us games by getting rid of a decent Thaddeus Young, and is planned to be a mentor for Wiggins and whoever we draft next. If you think he was brought in to win games you're a fool. It's sort of brilliant actually. When we wanted to drop Thaddeus Young for no on court production, Garnett's the only player we could really do that with. The mentoring stuff is a bonus."
"I don't think they planned his injuries..."

His middle 2 months (26 games) he had a .479 and .528 TS%.  
His last 2 months (24 games) LaVine had a .528 and a .567 TS%. 

Even though he played the fewest games in his last 2 months, he played the most minutes and took far more shots than in the other 2 2-month periods. In other words, he scored more points more efficiently and in fact had GOOD efficiency as a relatively high volume scorer his last 2 months overall.

http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lavinza01/splits/2015/

One reason LaVine's numbers went up at the end of the season IMHO is clearly tied with him playing more SG minutes and fewer PG minutes. He's a natural SG that was asked to LEARN HOW TO PLAY PG HIS ROOKIE YEAR AFTER RUBIO WENT DOWN. Before that point we had Rubio/Williams at PG and Martin/Lavine at SG.  Flip used LaVine as a tank commander while using the PG position to teach him how to pass and run an offense, something you want your SG to be capable of even if he doesn't do it very often. I would think LaVine is going to be a better SG going forward because of his experience as a PG.  Clearly Flip did as well. But I think everyone sees him as a SG primarily, and this year as a development project."
"Oh that's sexy"
"His midrange jumper really is crazy reliable. It was probably one of the best endings to an offensive posession for the wolves this season disregarding the obvious lay ups and dunks."
"I think he's a lot more than a ceremonial grooming job. 

Besides the obvious parts about him being able to teach from a different perspective than the coaches i also think it's really valuable to have a great and experienced player believe in the coach and his system. 

I think Flip thinks the same way and it's partly what he also tried to do with Chaunsey Billups as well. "
"Something like $15 million / 2 years with a player option for the 2nd year sounds perfect to me. It's not like we got free agents waiting in line anyway and in 2 years the first rookies will need to be signed to new contracts so that also limits who's available.

Pair that contract with something like the Mo Williams signing and you've probably got the free agents offseason moves for the Timberwolves.

And he doesn't want to coach! You either get his coaching as a player or you don't get it."
"If he can play 14 mins for something like 30-40 games i'd spend a roster spot on him."
"He's definitely still good. The physical part will be up to him. He'll be banged up after every game and practice, but if he can stomach that he'll be out there playing."
"I think it was a pretty obvious thing to do against Amir Johnson, but Budinger definitely showed that it was a good idea as well.

I also think it's a result of more defensive Schemes playing a small 4 and switching to prevent open shooters."
"Yeah, it'll be tough to earn minutes, but as you said he had a really nice stretch as a small ball 4. 

I think Flip will continue to play him a bit as a small ball 4 and just double team off of mismatches. The give up is rebounds, but if Bud can outweigh that on the offensive end he'll probably earn 10 minutes at the 4."
"Thank You."
"Rubio isnt an NBA caliber PG? Or just that Wiggins had to play so many minutes with Lavine at PG who is terrible. "
"[Fixed](http://i.imgur.com/vNDh5ec.png)"
"I would assume the later since Rubio was out for most of the year"
"Except that wolves logo is ""retired"" isn't it?  I thought their two logos now are the gray/blue wolf howling, and the wolf face that's on center court 

I know, I know...I'm *that* guy that always complains about the wolves' designs, logos and color schemes. "

Realistic players(in that 5-6 million range), in my opinion, are:

* Jeremy Lin
* Brandon bass
* Aaron Brooks
* Nate Robinson (somehow only 30 years old)
* Tyler Hansborough
* Andrei Bargnani (don't laugh, he's a good value at the veteran's minimum)
* Brandon Wright

Granted, this can all trade drastically after draft night as we can be trading player and will draft needs as well. "
"I agree that it's a little overwhelming, but i think that there is a really cool idea here that we should look into replicating.W can simplify it a bit to make it less busy. I don't think you can dispute that Oregon has been on point with marketing over the last 10+ years tho"
"I like bass to pick up, however im betting he resigns in boston"
"yup, interesting"
"But he was 19 on Feb. 1, which is the date used."
"Lin would be good behind Rubio and could give us a good guard rotation of rubio, martin, lavine, and Lin. "
"JR Smith has thrown down some really nice dunks. "
"I'd only really be interested in Brandon Wright or Tyler Hansborough out of that list. Wright is a good, efficient big man. Hansborough plays physical and would complement Dieng."
"Brandon Roy"
"Idc what anyone says. **IF** Marc Gasol doesn't re-sign with Memphis, we have a good of a shot as any. He wants a small market team and he and Ricky are good friends. Next year will be his 7th season meaning his first year of a max contract would *only* cost us $17,695,200, a number we could work with. From then on it would be a matter of squeezing out some higher contracts (Pek/Martin/Bennett) and the new CBA, because he can claim up to 30% of the teams cap.

EDIT: Just want to make sure that I mean that we would HAVE to squeeze out one of those 3 contracts in order to get Marc, we would be under the Luxury tax line but we would only have 12 players on our roster excluding our draft picks (probably 1-3 more players)"
"Greg Oden?"
"That would be phenomenal if we could land Marc. He would really help space out the floor for players like wiggins and lavine, also as a top pnr player he can really help create space and plays for guys like wiggins and lavine as well"
"He would be the best possible coach for the Wolves next season, his defensive expertise is just what we need!"
"If he is fired he will have other, better head coaching jobs if he wants them. 

Orlando has a good young team with no coach, and the Pelicans' job might be open as well."
"Nail the draft. Re-sign KG. Go for a cheap veteran big such as Luis Scola.

Possibly trade a young guy + second rounder for Ersan Ilyasova?"
"This is the best case scenario for our franchise"
"Orlando is not better than what we can offer Thibs in potential with Wiggins "
"Are you serious?  0% chance."
"They could make the playoffs in the east next year with the right coach. No reason why their roster with Dipo, Fournier, Payton, Vucevic, Tobias Harris can't win 38 games with another year of experience."
"No reason *we* can't win 38 with all of our guys with another year of experience plus Towns/Okafor and not having everybody get injured."
"Add Bargnani and I agree. Look, I understand he's not Dirk, but this idea that he sucks is beyond insane."
"that is a very gross list except for one player, but youre probably right.  Flip would love Bass."
"Wright needs to play with a coach who has a great offensive system.  I wouldnt want him to waste away here, but him and towns together would be fun."
"The combination of Payton,  Oladipo, and Gordon is better than what the Wolves have between Wiggins and Rubio. Especially for the defensive system Thibs runs."
"Flip isn't going to give up his spot and no respectable coach wants to play for a franchise where the President still thinks he's a good coaching candidate. "
"I mean I think he will sign with Memphis, but if he doesn't, I don't see why Minnesota wouldn't be able to be on his shortlist"
"Bargnani is pretty decent on offense, but I don't think we need another big man who can't play defense."
"I'm team Scotty Brooks"
"They are looking like they're going to the finals...I'm still not on board that Chicago is going to fire him"
"oh god no Ersan Ilyasova. He sucks and hes on a bad contract. It'd be Darko all over again."
"Can he chug a beer like Darko?"
"This. I usually am pretty pissed off at your opinions on the Wolves but this is accurate. Orlando has a better nucleus of young guys than we do. We will be attractive after another year, but not yet."

"Throw in Nikola Vucevic who is still only 24 and putting up 20/11"
"I admire your optimism but this is the longest of long shots. Then again, I would have said the same one year ago thing about us acquiring Andrew Wiggins without winning the lottery. "
"True, but 38 wins gets you in the playoffs in the east while that will only net you 11th in the West. Granted, I'd like to think ours is more promising an argument could be made for Orlando. We have the best piece as far as young potential go but you could argue they have a bigger collection of pieces with a bit more experience already and the allure of being able to make the playoffs and stick it to the Bulls if he were fired may be just enough to do it.

And if the Pelicans job opens up that's even better. Get to build around what's becoming the best, if not already, the best big man in Anthony Davis on a team that's made a playoff berth."
"[Apparently they're also putting them up on billboards.](http://i.imgur.com/omlhJEe.jpg) this one reminds me of the endorsements you get in 2K."
"His tattoos sure can't"
"Doppppeee"
"I doubt Thibs would be content with winning 38-40 games and then getting bounced in the first round year after year.

That is not a desirable outcome, especially the way the draft is set up to favor the West slightly, perpetuating the conference talent imbalance.

I honestly think the Wolves job, strictly from a basketball sense, is more desirable than Orlando.  Maybe not quite as good as the Pellies, but their roster is kind of a disaster outside of Anthony Davis and they don't have a lot of flexibility to put pieces around him at the moment either."
"The dude wants to play for a contending team, who has a real possibility to go to the finals if he joins. There is 0 chance he comes here, even if he is friends with Rubio. Maybe if he was a bit younger or older.... But he's looking for a big contract and a playoff contender."
"Making the playoffs in the east 'next season' isn't really an accomplishment considering how easy the east is. I'm sure Thibs rather have the next all-star to work with and plan for year down the road instead of the next couple seasons."
"Without the 'tude, please."
"Bjelica "
"[Reminds me of this and idk why]
(http://i.imgur.com/mtL8CnT.jpg)"
"I've said this, there's a 90% chance he goes back to memphis, but if he doesn't we have just as well of a shot as anyone. Minnesota WILL be a playoff team by the 2016-2017 season, we may be fighting for an 8 seed but we will be a playoff team. QUOTE ME."
"Tobias will not be on the Magic next year

EDIT: meant to say AFTER next year, and he is a rfa, but I don't think the Magic would match what could end up being a max contract"
"Don't see any overwhelming reason to spend any serious or even moderate money for a vet to come aboard...At least not for a year or two. Let the young guys figure it out and grow together "
"You are such a positive person"
"[deleted]"
"I actually don't want him. He teaches GREAT defense with the overloading of the strong side, but the way he overplays starters would be too big of a risk, especially given our past injury history. "
"Honestly, I would want one more veteran presence who has playoff experience, the can be a great mentor and offer a silver lining because KG rides everyones ass hard. If one Vet is screaming and yelling at his players in a positive way having a level headed vet could really help the players as well. Not to mention it could ease the locker room."
"So where would he go then?  Why not here?"
"Thank you for using re-sign correctly."
"Nobody ever seems to talk about this guy but Paul Millsap would be such a great fit on this team, especially if we land Towns or Okafor.  He's one of the (if not the) most underrated 4s in the league, imo."
"Looking like? It's only been 1 game"
"Playoffs and Orlando weather, or no playoffs and Minnesota weather? Hmmm... "
"Bring em' back!!!"
"Yeah he is, it's like a breathe of fresh air....."
"It's in the lips."
"I would freak the fuck out if we got Hansborough. I am a life long UNC fan and came to the Wolves in 2010 because I wasn't close enough to Charlotte to attend many if any games. My motto has always been if I can't make a game regularly then I find the team I most enjoy watching which was the Wolves at the time along with the Rubio hype. I would buy a Twolves Hansborough jersey fast as shit regardless of how long he'd stay in it."
"If we put him at the 4 with Towns/Okafor at the 5 I think we would be alright."
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcz_kDCBTBk
"
"i for one am absolutely not ok with that. but luckily that comparison is pretty dumb and invalid so"
"JR Smith is a national treasure"
"I like the hope but I don't think we can get to the playoffs in the West quite yet.  I think it'll take like 48 wins to get the 8 seed next year, and I don't see that from this team, regardless of who we get in the draft (and realistically, barring a trade we're not getting anyone that matters in FA).


If it were the East though I'd probably bet on us getting the 6 seed."
"Andrew Wiggins and a ship"
"Hopefully some of the West's big FA will go to the East. Gasol, LMA, Draymond Green, Deandre Jordan are some names off the top of my head who might leave. While these teams stay relatively stagnant we are moving in the right direction. Imagine how teams would defend us if we went small with Rubio, LaVine, Wiggins, Bazz, and (insert center)?"
"There isn't much to be positive about the Timberwolves.  "
"&gt; Imagine how teams would defend us if we went small with Rubio, LaVine, Wiggins, Bazz, and (insert center)?

Probably better than we'd defend them :v

&gt;  Gasol, LMA, Draymond Green, Deandre Jordan are some names off the top of my head who might leave.

Green is RFA so I reeeeeeeeeealy don't see him going anywhere.  As far as the rest of them, there are big FAs in the east, too.  And if they sign in the west then it's just a power shuffle at the top.  The only one I really see as maybe leaving is LMA, anyway.  But to even get to the 8 seed the Wolves realistically need to jump at least two playoff teams, because don't forget OKC missed the playoffs.  And Utah started to look good at the end of the year too..."
"I wouldn't try to go small on a team like Memphis but a small ball lineup would be similar to the no huddle offense in football, it would be about the situation. A ton of teams employ that strategy. The point about the West is that I don't think it can get any better than it has been this year. I do not think we will see two Eastern Conference teams make the playoffs with losing records again. Chicago, Miami, Washington, Cleveland, Atlanta will all be healthy next year. Throw in the Bucks and Celtics who continue to improve, the Pacers will Paul George back, and the Regular Season Raptors and you have some competitiveness going on there."
"Phoenix too, they have a great young core and ALOT of money to spend this offseason. "
"He runs his players into the ground with insane minutes. He likes to play 8 deep and with our roster we are going to be 10 deep easily. With how injured this team has been I don't think he fits good with his style of heavy minutes."
"Fully  expect us to  go undefeated  and win  it all"
"I hope so man. Watching the playoffs, we sure need to get this 'team defense' thing down. "
"Should have gone after Donovan. 

Guy runs a team first approach with a nice 3 ball to inside action offense. "
"Sure we can, if they realign the conferences, and we're in the leastern conference"
"The idea of a Bargnani/Okafor front court makes me physically ill.  That's probably worse defensively than the feared Love/Pek tandem."
"Well, we'd have $11m to spend IF we didn't sign KG, Hummel, Bjelica, and our draft picks. Unless we can shed Pek's contract. Even if we breach the cap to stay under the Luxury tax we won't get anyone over 3-4m/yr. Next year is the year we go after free agents. We will have $33m in contracts and the projected cap is almost $90m"
"&gt; Bjelica

I'd much rather have him than some free agent rental but he hasn't made it official he is coming over yet. I also see it unlikely that we carry 4 PFs on the roster."
"I don't expect Anthony Bennett to end next year in a Timberwolves jersey."
"I hope I don't see him in a Wolves jersey next year. but realistically I think he will be. Nobody will trade for him or Bud. If we could get them off the roster I'd do backflips but I just don't see Glenn Taylor throwing away $10 million. Neither of them are going to have a future with this team. The jury is still out on Payne, I want to see what another year with KG does for him."
"I mean Obviously I love the KAT and Vaughn pick but I don't know much about Kenneth Smith.

EDIT: I guess he's a combo guard who shot 37% from the field, 36% from three and averaged 6.4pts, 4.0rpg, 7.4 assists and 1.9 steals. I don't usually judge players based on stats but that's not a very appealing stat line."
"If he honestly thinks WCS will drop to 11th I need whatever he is smoking.

Also, I doubt he knows much about the Wolves since he has LaVine penciled in behind Rubio at PG. LaVine is a shoot guard, not a point guard."
"He won't fall past 8, but it's ok Chad will just change it later."
"Lol Chad Ford is a joke. I have no clue how he still has a job."
"I want us to trade pek so bad at this point I'd take a basket of balls for him. That would free up a lot of space. I also still, while I don't agree with it, could see us trading Kmart. Until then 11 mill is not that much for two rfas and two draft picks"
"Maaaaaaaaaaaaan..Okafor is getting really underrated here. Just know Flip would jump at the chance to draft him. "
"I've seen enough of big men who can't defend"
"Vaughn and Tyus!!!!!!"
"I'd love to have Tyus, but he won't fall to the 31st/32nd/33rd/34th pick"
"They said the exact same thing about Marc Gasol when he first entered the NBA. That he was too slow, didn't have the vertical ect... Look at him now. Look at Tim Duncan! Two guys who aren't the fastest on the at all and don't really jump. Yet have developed into top notch defenders"
"For every Gasol and Duncan you have 10 Kwame Browns. I'm not saying it can't happen, I just prefer the alternative option(s)."
"I hate being negative but I'm sorry mate, we will not be in the playoffs next year. The west is as wild as ever we are an up and coming team but do is Utah Phoenix Pelicans ect and the thunder will be back next year. Klove might go to the lakers which would create more competition. I won't say anything definitive past a year since so much can change. But we still have a loooonnnnnggggg ways to go. We have so much to fix and we are so young and injury prone. I hope your scenario comes true. I'll be the first to cheer the wolves to the playoffs. But that's just not Ganna happen for a while."
"I agree but brown didn't have the footwork okafor has which is a key building block to offensive and defensive development. But yes you are right there are multiple possibilities. The same goes for towns and WCS or whoever. "
"We could take him with our first pick ;)"
"Sounds like he could run the offense off the bench just like Rubio would"
"There's a lot better options out there than a kid who can't shoot in the C-USA..."
"Duncan was always a good defender, Gasol was one of the best defenders in the Euroleague while finishing top 10 in blocks in back to back seasons before coming to the NBA. What Okafor has shown in college on defense is far less impressive than the other 2 names you listed. Plus Okafor is in [this group](https://twitter.com/VJL_bball/status/593786947065151488), which baring an unforeseeable improvement is quite worrying. "

"It's the offseason anything can happen, possibilities are endless until proven otherwise. If you don't believe it it's better to just shit on everyone's dreams in those posts while being an insufferable curmudgeon like myself."

"So the juries still out on Payne, but not Bennett even though Bennett is two years younger...? That's logical. "
"Bennett has had substantially more playing time than Payne. Bennett has had 2 full seasons which, when he has been healthy, has been nothing short of awful. Payne was drafted last year and didn't play before we traded for him. The jury is still out on Payne. Bennett won't be in the NBA in two years. "
"So even when our sports wet dreams come true we go 16-66 and are the worst team in the league?

"2 2nd rounders aren't worth a future first. "
"it's almost like all these writers and ""experts"" are daring Flip to draft him"
"He literally says in the article that he expects WCS to go #6 to the Kings. He's not predicting Cauley-Stein falls to #11, he's saying that is where he would go if Chad Ford ran all 30 teams."
"Even if k love goes to the LAL, idk if they would be better than us haha "
"I like Lorenzo too. He can't shoot the ball at all but he plays good defense, has great height and length, and seems to have a good feel for the point guard position. If he gains some weight I think he could be a solid rotation player - maybe have a Kirk Hinrich type of career."
"[deleted]"
"What? How the fuck does this guy have any credibility left? How are we still looking at this?"
"who brought up gasol????? good lord"
"an okafor/randle front court would be terrible defensively.  I would love to see that in LA."
"i like em"
"I miss the green, man. Green jerseys would be dope."
"If the Thibs situation in Chicago is what people say it is I don't see why we can't land him. Crazier things have happened. We had Rick Adelman as a coach who's a legend to me."
"Curious, the Kings are probably going to be drafting in the top 6. Would you guys be willing to ship Dieng and Martin for the pick? Assuming you guys draft KAT or Okafor"
"I think it would be foolish for him to opt out after this year. He underperformed and got hurt, unless a team he really wants to play on is going to offer him a max deal this offseason, which seems unlikely, he will probably be in Cleveland next year."
"Ray is pretty distant from the Big 3 and if he was to play he'd probably choose a contender."
"I didn't necessarily read competitive as the playoffs. Yeah, the west is tough, but I think being competitive means being better than a team like the Phoenix Suns, winning slightly less than .500. "
"But if we're paying for him we might as well keep him. To my knowledge he's not toxic. The only reason I would see letting him go is if we need the roster spot

Edit: but I still really want us to trade him to get rid of his salary"
"For the record, this isn't my design; I found it online.

Full look:

http://www.matthewwolffdesign.com/portfolio/minnesota-timberwolves-wolff-grey-alternate/

I don't *dislike* the current jerseys, per se, but these look amazing. Not a fan of the grey coloring — I'd rather have that be black — but otherwise would love a redesign based upon this sort of thing."
"I'd do Dieng, Martin, and give you guys your 2nd rounder back.

Dieng is a bit overrated I think. He has a diverse skill set offensively but his reputation on D is much better than his actual skill on that side of the ball. He's not terrible defensively, but definitely not great either. He can stretch the floor from the center position though as well as play some PF and he blocks a lot of shots, so I think that would be a fair package. Assuming we take Landry or Thompson back, whoever the Kings like less?"
"What are second-rounders for, right?"
"This looks awesome! Thanks for putting in the effort to make this!"
"I definitely like the idea of gray and the tree trim.  I am not sure about the cut of the jersey, otherwise i like it."
"Two very high second rounders? They definitely are. Not talking about trading for a top five pick, here, just to a contender for a couple of second-round role players is all."
"That would be a done deal imo. We get a real starting SG and maybe someone who can pair up next to Cousins. Not to mention we send back Carl Landry too. We don't like Landry. He's basically Thad Young without the hustle and post game. He basically just stands there and takes mid range jumpers. He can give you a solid 10pts 5rebs a night, but 0 on defense. 

Do you think Dieng would be a good fit next to Cuz? It would be perfect for us. At around pick 6, we'd be looking at WCS and bigs to pair up next to Cuz. We might as well just trade it for a more known player AND a starting SG. 

I think that 2nd rounder will be important for us too. "
"Of course we would, but Sac would never do that."
"I always wanted to see what we'd look like in gray"
"Ray Allen would not come here..... If he's going anywhere he is going to a competitor. "
"I think we probably would especially if we believe Dieng is the fit next to Cousins. If we draft around 6, we are looking at potential suitors next to Cousins. Dieng could be one AND we would get a starting SG in Martin. "
"So essentially Martin and Dieng for WCS and your 2nd? I'd do that."
"Okay. I might be wrong, maybe i worded my gut feeling a bit harsh. Do you have any precedence to believe what you're believing? Who will be the team taking the trade?"
"This has been posted before, and I fucking love it. I would buy one immediately."
"I'm personally saying 2 years away from competing "
"""Just saw the large billboard of @22Wiggins looking down at me. #dope"" That guy made me feel like a rockstar haha "
"like it better than our current jerseys"
"I believe Miami recently traded their firsts for seconds to save money for the big three, for example."
"No, he's washed up and there is bad blood between him and KG"
"He wouldn't be perfect next to Boogie. Neither of them have great foot speed so guarding smaller, quicker fours would be a major problem."
"So do you want the front page to be ""Oh go we suck ass let's go kill ourselves?"" If you don't want to look for the hope in, not just sports, but in any situation then I honestly feel sorry about your outlook. What do positive thoughts hurt?"
"No problem."
"I like this one a lot"
"Thank you."
"doooope"
"They don't hurt anything.  I just find some of these views to be pretty outlandish.  I don't know what content should replace it, but I agree I don't want just negativity.  I was genuinely just curious as to why so much is what it is. "
"He wouldn't have left Florida for a rebuilding team, though. Heck, the only way he (or many other potential candidates) would consider moving to a midwest team is if that team's a contender. See: Cleveland, Oklahoma City. Otherwise we have little chance of snagging a big fish like Donovan."
"You're getting hated on but I agree; not the biggest fan of Flip either. May as well support him if he's committed to staying as coach though."
"My dad is a regular on CanisHoopus, while I post here. Having followed the team since their inception, he's a big pessimist about the Timberwolves, while I'm still young(ish) and naively optimistic. Funny how it works out that way!"
"Yeah I assumed someone had posted it before, my bad. With some minor revisions I would also buy one."
"We need to introduce green back into the color scheme!"
"To be fair I spend most of my time there and think some of the posts here are a bit off the wall but once in awhile it's nice to believe Payne will be a useful player or that Zach can actually play point guard."
"Wow, I figured you were a Wolves fan suggesting this and I was going to call you crazy, I'd definitely take this as a Wolves fan, I don't think Kings would though, but I'm sure you know more about them than I do"
"Damn you guys are crazy. Downvoting a simple post to oblivion for no reason whatsoever, plus sending me hate PM's? I didn't know you guys were so hardcore."
"You'd have to flip Pek for sure to get even close to what Millsap will make."
"Maybe, does he still have the same agent?  Because we might be able to get him for the MLE if he does."
"Cap jump is going to make every contract balloon. Millsap's on a major bargain contract (one of the most team-friendly contracts in the league)—he's not going to make that mistake again."
"&gt; he's not going to make that mistake again

Maybe, does he have the same agent?  Because we might be able to get him for the MLE if he does."
"To be fair, he's technically not wrong at the moment."
"Probably the same agent. Can't find that info. But MLE is $5million for you guys, I think. Millsap makes 8. And he's going to take less money when he's proven he's worth more than he's making? 5 million is what Dion Waiters makes on his rookie contract.

He could have Barney Fife as his agent and still get paid more than $10mil."
"I agree. Isn't that Kevin Martin?"
"&gt; Probably the same agent.

Then we might be able to get him for the MLE."
"Its really hard to say right now, so much can change. Ask me after next season"
"Dope. 

And much love to everyone on here making original content. You guys are great."
"I agree we're 2 years away from competing for a playoff spot. Probably 3-5 away from competing for the second round of playoffs on. "

"there have been rumors that the court will be getting updated with the new renovations this summer. when you spend ~150 million on making things look newer then you have to guess the floor is a big part of that. the tour guides at the mayo clinic square facility have said the court there will be the exact same one at the target center.

"I don't like the tree lining and I absolutely can't stand is the font used for Wolves. The jagged-ness of the letters is too much. They need to go for a timeless look. The colors, however, are great."
"Good for you man, got goose bumps at the end with that Wiggles dunk. Just a little advice, try input some actual game audio. Jim Peterson and Dave Benz can get you really hyped. Good song choice too, love me some lupe! Just curious where you got your clips from?"
"I'd be interested in doing something like Cleveland where they could have the Minneapolis Skyline on one of the courtsides. "
"Clips all just from YouTube which I figured out how to download it was pretty easy. I did think a whole lot about putting some game audio into it but I didn't know what would work and didn't want it to seem cluttered. Love the feedback though man, looking back would have been awesome to but in but I got lazy haha. "

You'd have Bjelica. He's a good player. He'll be our starting PF. Don't listen to most people on this sub who doubt him. Most of them have never seen him."
"Oh and he's past the point of floor/ceiling conversations in my opinion. He is a veteran player. He is what he is."
"on a scale of deandre jordan to andrea bargnani how is his D?"
"[Here's an article breaking him down](http://www.canishoopus.com/2015/4/2/8330819/what-can-the-wolves-expect-from-nemanja-bjelica). Worth noting he turns 27 tomorrow so if he wants to play in the NBA it's gotta be soon. 

TL;DR he's a PG in the body of a 6'10 PF. Good ball handling for his size and seems to be an efficient shooter. Doubt he'll be more than an average defender at this level."
"If KG re-signs he will start, but I bet Bjelica will get the majority of the minutes at the 4.

If those two are both on the team next season I think that we'll trade Bennett and have Payne take the rest of the backup minutes."
"Bazzy could be one of those instant offense 6th men, though. I love the defensive potential of a Rubio-Wiggins-Winslow backcourt"
"Closer to Bargnani."
"Nice, hadn't seen this. The analysis of his movement is spot on. He runs kinda.... Weird."
"Before you start bashing this because its from B/R... I posted it because its a featured column written by Ian Levy.

I'm sure B/R just paid him a substantial amount to write a featured column. Check it out, as it really does a great job explaining the hate on our ROTY for having below average advanced statistics."
"what about our potential pick this year? if we draft a 4 or 4/5 would he take bjelica's spot? "
"If we draft a big I'd only want Towns/Okafor/WCS, and none of them should get many minutes a the 4 (Towns could maybe get a few). The potential logjam at the 4 would be a mess if we get Prozy. 

I've moved on from Pek ever returning and being a significant contributor, I'm ready to move on with drafting a center and having Gorgui back him up."
"hmm yea for some reason i forgot towns would be more of a 5. i guess he could play some 4 though.  "
"same was said about Joakim Noah, and I've liked what he's done with his career thus far.  If we could end up with a Noah type player at the 4th overall pick, sign me up!"

"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every [MLB](http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/2qqn1n/rbaseballs_and_each_team_subs_most_used_words_of/), [Soccer](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2r6har/rpremierleague_and_premier_league_team_subs_most/), [NHL](http://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/2s34iy/rhockeys_and_nhl_team_subs_most_used_words_of_2014/), [NBA](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/2r1hro/rnbas_and_team_subreddits_most_used_words_of_2014/), and [NFL](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/2rejc3/rnfls_and_team_subs_most_used_words_of_2014/) team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my [Swears/Subscriber Breakdown](http://imgur.com/gallery/TPI0i/new) by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous [sports profanity breakdown](http://imgur.com/gallery/dYyF0). I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."
"This could be great or disastrous.  If he could defend small forwards it would be terrific.  He is so athletic.  It will be interesting to see.  If he cant guard 3s losing the weight might be the nail in the koffin.  you need the weight to guard 4s.  Make or break year for him clearly.  "
"2 blocks per 40 isn't bad in a vacuum, but its not good enough to put him in the same tier as Towns. "

"He truly assumes the worst teams will draft by need and not best player available. This guy is an idiot. "
"He lost a ton of weight last offseason but put a few back on as the season progressed.

He needs to play the 4 and I think he is missing a step of quickness. Even if it puts him in a bind against some of the bigger 4's, getting no  quicker step is sorely needed. So often he is in a good position in the post but just can't move fast enough.

If he loses the weight, he's going to get pushed around by the big guys. If he doesn't, then he's going to move too slow. He can't mimic Bazz's style of play since Bazz just overpowers the smaller 3's for his post up game.

I don't think the AB train has sailed quite yet, but it's losing a lot of steam."

"probably less likely of a proposition"
"how is it less?  developing the basketball skills to play a 3 on offense takes years.  Becoming quicker, for someone that is can lose pounds is easier.  And the nice part is he is super athletic.  "
"Pretty sure he's saying Bennett will suck both on offense and defense playing the 3. "
"He doesn't need to work on his shot so much as he needs to work on his rebounding, post offense, post defense, off ball defense, off ball offense, ball handling, court awareness, translation defense, passing..."
"So Pek didn't improve from his rookie season?"
"LaVine's got a bit more to prove before he can be either a legit NBA starter or 6th man. Bazz is already putting up those numbers"
"I'd rather give him the chance to prove either before drafting someone who would relegate him to a permanent deep bench role. "
"Pek wasn't as mature as a player when he came over. Apples to oranges man"
"yes on the offensive end but if he can get his quickness up a bit he could play the 3 defence.  I agree he isnt a three on offense but it wouldnt hurt if we wanted to go big.
edit:  I forgot to say i agree he is not a 3 on offense.  and i hope its clear im not saaying he should be a 3 on offense."
"Bennett has never been a good defender, he had the quickness or whatever in college it didn't matter then and it won't matter now. He's too soft, he gets lost when defending off the ball, and frankly half asses put their too.  

 His best option to remain in the NBA is to become a better 3 point shooter and be relegated to a stretch 4 like Ryan Anderson or a poor man's version of what Love was on the Cavs this season. That makes much more sense than trying to fit him at the 3 where he doesn't have the skillset to play on offense or defense. "

"Being a reliable mid range or even 3pt shooter could be the start to develop into a dependable part of the bench unit. This would probably also improve his already decent ability to cut hard off of the pnr.

For me defense comes next, but i really don't think he's that far from being a neutral on that end of the floor. He's a bit small and lacks awareness, but i was somewhat surprised with his level of effort this season and if he throws some extra pounds i don't think that'll be an issue."

"Players almost always develop their first 2 years in the NBA. It's part of the learning curve coming over, you have to. I agree with the greater point, but he'll still likely become a more skillful player BBIQ wise and probably learn a couple new moves to adjust to the rule changes."

"I think the injury really messed him up. He has also said numerous times that he hasn't ever been back to his college weight. Hopefully when he does get their his confidence improves.

Dude has flashes but his consistency is awful."
"He's too short to play the 4. Being a bigger 3 is a risk that he should take because trying to play PF in this league has been disastrous for him."
"I agree 100% that he needs to develop a 3 and that his spot, and why he was drfted was as a stretch 4.  im just saying that if he loses 15 lbs.  He is already undersized and is a twiner.  losing the weight and staying at the 4 on the defensive end will lead to him getting bullied around."
"Haha"
"I think the more popular teams will have their own game threads whereas we don't really. Game threads are full of reactions which would include lots of short curse-filled posts. I think that contributes to a lot of this since you see the upper tier teams also have more swearing.

I'm sure in a few years when Wiggins blossoms and we're ready to make our run, we'll end up like the rest of the teams too, but it's encouraging to see. Also encouraging is that despite being the worst team, we are in the middle in terms of subscribers."
"I'm still amazed at how quickly he can go vertical. It seems like he can run full speed right under the basket and still go up straight; same kind of fluidity in his jumpshot as well. "
"I just called house of hoops, they had 29 pairs in store that sold out day of for $130, and they're selling on eBay now for $500. I'm pretty bummed I missed this!"
"And I'm saying it won't matter what position he'll play he's going to get bullied regardless no matter what position he plays regardless if he loses weight or not. He's a bad defender that isn't going to change in a single offseason or ever probably. "
"Fucking anxiety already... I am ready to be dissapointed."
"Based on Wolfson and Zgoda's tweets I'm pretty confident the Wolves are walking away from the draft with either Okafor or Porzingis no matter where they land in the lottery 1-4. "
"Canadian here. Bennett has a beautiful stroke. Conditioning obviously is a factor. But honestly watching him he looks mentally off-put in some way. How can a guy be desperate for minutes and look like it doesnt even matter, and this is his second team? Fuck he looked so good in summer league, wth "
"without skill, he should be kenneth faried"
"I'm not a Porzingis fan. But I don't even care if we fall to 4 (obviously would rather be 1, but I wouldn't be devastated) , I think you could say the top 5 players to go are respectively in the first tier of talent. No one much higher than the other."
"Minnesota Nice."
"If that's the case, we should be planning riots around Target Center...

Really though, It will be depressing if we fall to 3 (or 2) and Flip is taking Porzingis regardless of who's on the board. "
"It's in the Association's best interest(s) for LA or NY to go 1-2"
"[deleted]"
"Nope, he isn't."
"Which will happen"
"Knicks are getting the first pick, Lakers aren't falling out of the top three... Wolves at four."
"oh no argument from me good sir.  My guess is he will be dealt this summer "
"Such a risky pick.... If we use a top 4 pick to gamble on an upside player that will probably be available at 7 or 8 I will be crazy disappointed."
"Flip said his goal for the summer is adding defense and a shooter. Neither of those guys fit that description really."
"Not really. LA has a huge fan base but they have to share with Clippers. I think it's also in the leagues best interest to surround Andrew Wiggins with some talent. He is the future airness."
"But isn't Wolfson basing his Wolves draft board on info he got months ago?  I hope to God in Heaven that Flip at least has KAT ahead of Okafor at this point.."
"Even if Wiggins is the next Airness, then it would be in the league's best interest to keep us so shitty that Wiggins is motivated to sign elsewhere after his rookie contract expires.  Or pull a ""Kevin Love"" and demand a trade during his second contract because all we managed to do was surround him with Wes Johnson and Derrick Williams."
"Southern California could handle 3 teams. It's a huge market, and LA definitely has no trouble supporting 2 basketball teams"
"May the ping pong balls stay true to the spirit of the North Star. May Flip's draft board be righteous.  May the envelopes not be rigged.

In Wiggins' name we pray. Amen."
"I thought he said he wanted the young guys to get stronger so they'd be better defenders and for them to work on their shooting on their own.   

At least in Porzingis case if he gets stronger he could be a good defender based on his length and athleticism. He also does look like he has a decent shot for a big man.   

I don't buy any of what Flip says personally but that info on Okafor and Porzingis comes from guys that have inside sources. "
"I hope so too but Okafor's agent is also Flip's buddy Bill Duffey so it's really likely the Wolves end up with him. "
"If we end up with nothing but a couple of overdrafted Flippophantic prospects and cash considerations, I'm gonna be angry. "
"Yeah LA is a huge market. But I'm saying you could make a case for the lottery being rigged for every team. "
"Oh, well that's depressing!"
"I think russell &gt;porzingis for flip, doogie also repeated that sentiment, that said I think he goes before okafor"
"Until I hear otherwise that's what I'm expecting.  Keeping expectations low."
"&gt; Oh, well that's depressing!

That's ok, because it's not reality.  Between the two fantasies of ""Wiggins is the next Jordan"" and ""the League is conspiring against us"" lies the truth that neither Adam Silver nor any of his underlings really cares about us.  We'll either get lucky and become good, or we won't."
"Any word on who The Wolves want? I would think they want KAT. It's been a open secret that The Knicks want him."
"I'd absolutely do that deal straight up. "
"That's a great deal for us. This is why I think Flip should trade Gorgui before people around the league realize he can't defend. Dieng alone would get a pick in the mid first round, Kmart maybe a pick in the 23-30 range. If both can be packaged for a top 10 pick and an admittedly pretty terrible contract guy in Landry, I'd do it."
"Not a big fan of Landry's contract, but otherwise it's a great deal."
"Take that deal. Save money with the Martin for Landry swap, Dieng isn't that good and getting a good pick for him is highway robbery. No way Sacramento actually does that deal though since the Wolves would make out like bandits. "
"As long as we get Towns I would probably do the trade. Dieng is not a starter. Just a rotational big."
"It's virtually identical to K Mart's (actually a little cheaper, I think), so we don't really lose anything in terms of cap flexibility"
"Thats a fantastic deal (for us)"
"Sac is wanting to trade the pick I hear so that's why I mentioned this. The biggest rumor out there, or the one that has the most steam, is John Henson+1st for Sac's first"
"Landry's deal 1.4m cheaper over the length, they are the same length of contract (Both ufa in 2017)

EDIT: Contract amount was off"
"Every sub that isn't number one is doing this."
"Said it up top Wolves reporters think Flip loves Okafor."
"I sprint to the phone, and say deal deal no take backs on the trade and do it.  I love gorgi but a 6th overall in the is draft is solid would try to get it before the lotto to add to the probability of getting top 3. "
"That trade would be a complete steal for us. Landry's contract is slightly better than KMart's, which is already pretty great and Gorgui seems to be very much overrated as a defender by the rest of the league. Having WCS as well as a top 4 pick would be just too good to turn down.

I wouldn't even put it past the Kings FO to do a completely one-sided deal like this."
"Mash accept"
"Surest way to get more downvotes? Complain about downvotes. Don't take internet points so personally."
"Do we have to take both years at one or can we choose to just take the third year and let him go after next year? "
"Everyone will want to take Towns with the first pick. I think Okafor will definitely be next on our board, but I trust Flip to make the right choice with the first pick.

That being said, I'd still be very happy with Okafor and I think his physical tools and his really amazing decision making and BBIQ will make him into an amazing NBA player.

Apparently Porzingis might also be up there if we fall lower than two. Don't think it's the right idea, but Flip's proved me wrong three times before.
"
"why don't we trade pek then, he can't defend either"
"Wolfson seems pretty sure that it's between Okafor and Towns with Okafor having the lead. 

I think the only way that Porizingis is an option is if the Wolves land at 4 and all of Okafor, Towns, and Russell are off the board (which is actually a fairly low chance). "
"He has less value in a trade because of their contracts. Pek makes 11-12m annually, Gorgui is on a rookie deal."
"If WCS is there then 100% yes"
"1.KAT
2. Russell
3. Okafor
4. Winslow."
"[deleted]"
"Wait, why would SAC do that?  I don't understand the move for them."
"Thanks for your interest!
We now have a Facebook page with all of our hours and more http://Facebook.com/WhatsPoppinRF"
"I love Martin to death but I would take that deal quick as shit."
"We've locked him up for next season and if I'm not mistaken, the season after that is when we can make a qualifying offer and match any other contact he signs. I doubt we'll do that unless he gets significantly better this year. "
"Landry's contract is definitely worse, but that's one of the advantages in this trade imo. Landry shouldn't get more than 15 minutes on any team, Martin is good enough to demand 25 a game. Clears up rotation minutes for Bazz and Lavine. "
"If both Porzingis and WCS were there with that pick, assuming you already got Okafor or Towns with the 1st/2nd, who would you rather take?

Also, this deal would likely have to include a Bazz/Stauskas swap for Sac to actually do it, still a go?"
"He also has less value because he's made of glass."
"No way the Kings would be stupid enough to do this. Why would they trade for Martin when they already have Mcelmore and Stauskas?"
"Pek hasn't been healthy for over two years. Hell, he's in a boot [right now](https://twitter.com/MrDee25/status/597167799446962176)."

"How about Pekovic/Rubio for landry and their pick, or for that matter just their pick. Get rid of a lot of money. Get rid of one guy who cant play more than 15 games in a row because there is simply too much pressure on his ankles. Get rid of the other guy who is a liability due to his inability to shoot consistently (albeit he did show some signs of progress this past season changing his form, he also shot a lower percentage than his career avg.), don't get me wrong rubio plays an exciting brand basketball, he is crafty in more aspects of the game than solely his ability to distribute, but i bet we could find more efficiency with a guy like jerian grant or terry rozier, or even mudiay if we were able to get a pick high enough where he could possibly fall. Keep dieng who is still developing and while he is somewhat weak he is a block machine, and has that elbow shot to boot. I feel dieng has a high ceiling.  Draft a point guard. Let him and lavine do battle. Keep some vets like Neal and martin. I would hope kg stays on as a player coach allowing him to focus on Dieng. (rookie pg or lavine, martin, wiggins, Karl Anthony Towns, Dieng) Keep Adrian Payne, he can kind of defend. Keep Robbie Hummel! "
"Stauskas is trash, although I do like McLemore, but they use him as a 2-3 combo guard/forward. Sometimes he plays the 3 when Rudy is on the bench"
"So Dieng, Bazz, and Martin for essentially WCS, Landry and Stauskas? Idk that's a lot. I have a lot of faith in Bazzy to be a great player. He has a good of a shot as anyone to win MIPOY next year. Could maybe one day win 6MOY. So probably not.

And WCS over Porzingis anyday of the week."
"Guys! Guys! Bennett + Martin and a second round pick and this would totally work. "
"They have a logjam of 4's as it is. Dieng can play the 5 that's why that deal works."
"Trading Bazz is a bad idea for us "
"Sell high is a brilliant technique in sports. Dieng IMO is a perfect sell high. And his near 2 BPG might make him look like he's a better defender than he actually is, as well as maybe teams having hope that since he's only entering his 3rd year, he will improve on that end. "
"I came here to write this. His shot is actually pretty good - Wiggins was interviewed a while back and called out Bennett's shot as one of his unsung attributes. Personally, I'd rather his shot was a bit rubbish, which would actually force him to drive it inside once in a while."
"this video was FANTASTIC. keep it up!"
"He also gets down the court faster than anyone.  His acceleration is pretty crazy.  He just blows past everyone."
"They probably do that because they have no depth at SF"
"They literaly gave Rubio a contract last season, they want him to be one of the faces for the future"
"Anybody who has ever watched timberwolves basketball on a consistent basis knows we are an infinitely better team with Rubio on the court. Forget his scoring liabilities (which he had showed improvement on this season), the dude does everything else you want in your PG. Amazing passer, above average rebounder, terrific defender and has length at the point position. He's shown he's a leader and has a passion for the game which the younger guys will feed off of. I don't know what that other dude was smoking but Rubio is the guy that makes our team run. He's suffered a few freak accident injuries which have been unfortunate but that doesn't equate to someone being injury prone. Just unlucky in a few awkward situations. I have no worries about Ricky going forward and truly believe he will do wonders with the team we are building. "
"Our time for glory will come brother."

"If we can get a healthy season out of everyone that would be very helpful."
"I'd be most excited for all the Wolves fans that were too young to remember the last time we made it to the playoffs. "
"I'm sure he'll be good, but so far every highlight I've seen of him is over in China and it just seems **WAY** to easy for him.  Can't trust that right now..."
"Tell me about it. I missed the entire garnett era and didnt start being a twolves fan until  the klove knuckle pushup season. Having twolves basketball beyond April is foreign to me."
"Dude is a 19 year old with a Mazaratti "
"I'm not sure why they had the shot of him driving up to Minneapolis with snow on the ground. I was in Minneapolis that day and there was no snow, it was like 80 degrees."
"dude it was like 10 years ago, not 1918 "
"Love this kid. Can't imagine what I'd do if I drove past him on the highway... "
"I know, but I have great memories of being 12 and going to Timberwolves games, the arena was always packed, making sure to watch every game on TV, the KG4MVP campaign, watching them finally make it through the first round. I'll be a fan forever because of that. "
"Same here...I was in college during their ""golden years"". I remember a big billboard being erected in St. Cloud that said ""KG 4 MVP"". I hope we can get that back because this state is AWESOME when we have a winner to get behind. "
"Maserati* - Sorry, car guy.
Good choice in car!"
"When Adidas offers you a $10-12 mil shoe deal your rookie year for the next 5 years, I think you can splurge a bit...."
"It doesn't matter that I hardly missed a game last year. Or that I was high when I wrote that. Four years from now when the rubio era wolves haven't made it past the first round of the playoffs, people will think, ""maybe rubio isn't a championship point guard?"" I think the vast majority of this state i love so much is made up of bumpkins who were/still are mystified by rubio's spanish last name (""gives a spurs vibe"") and ability to dish the rock (""gives us a spurs vibe""). On a championship team Ricky is a backup. How the fuck did we give him a max deal and not k-love...kahn... 

And you said his shooting improved. Like i said his new mechanics did look nice but he still shot a lower percentage. I want him to do better, I hope he does. I want the team to do better, I know he's not going anywhere, but a guy can dream. 

As far as his injuries being a matter of freak accidents. Possibly, but from the naked eye he still looks brittle even after being in the league for four seasons at 24 years of age. 

I don't know i'm a little unconventional, and that idea is highly unlikely, but I'm thinking about rings. I also thought we should have traded ap's dumb ass two seasons ago...could have picked up a whole new defense for the vikes those days. "
"""Golden Year"" is more accurate. And given they lost to the team who lost to the champs, we could get away with calling it a ""Bronze Year"""
"Fuck off with that negativity, KG's rookie year up until 2004 or so were all a lot of fun to watch. 

This year was our worst year ever and it was fun to watch because of Wiggins."

"yeah, it was the day of the NFL draft, weather was perfect"
"Groovy tunes. Great video. Can't wait for next year."
"Awesome video percy, I look forward to many more highlight vids from you and these two. "
"Based on a mixture of production in their first two seasons and potential shown:

1. Noel (6)

2. Gobert (27)

3. Giannis (15)

4. Oladipo (2)

5. Bazz (14)

6. MCW (11)

7. Steven Adams (12)

8. Otto Porter (3)

9. Ben McLemore (7)

10. Alex Len (5)

Dieng (21) in the late lottery, probably 11th or maybe 10th over Len, Bennett (1) late in the first based 100% on his athletic gifts.

Edit: adding actual draft positions in parentheses, just to show what a crap shoot the draft, and even the lottery, really was.

"
"My top 10 in a redraft:  

1. Noel: Probably should have gone #1 in 2013 anyway based on his upside and defensive ability. Already a destructive force on defense, may eventually be DPOY.
2. Giannis: Upside is massive plus he already is a solid wing defender could eventually be one of the most versatile players in the league. 
3. Gobert: French Rejection, Stifle Tower, doesn't matter what you call him he is stuffing whoever comes into his domain (Not including Andrew Wiggins).
4. Oladipo: Solid defender already, could eventually be really good on that end. Averaged 17.9 ppg this last season if he ever figures out his shooting from distance he could be a perennial All-Star. 
5. MCW: Solid PG, good length, can run a stable offense, gets rebounds and assists. If he ever figures out how to score efficiently he could be a top 10 PG. 
6. Plumlee: Solid rotational center, learned under KG how to be tough. Very productive and reliable on the playoff Nets. 
7. Adams: Solid rotational center. Agitator, and brings it on defense. 
8. Porter: One of my favs entering the draft. Struggles to get minutes because Wittman sucks, but has been pretty solid in these playoffs this year. In my opinion he's the next Paul Pierce, if we do this in another year I could see him being higher. 
9. Olynyk: Done well as a stretch 4 in Boston. 
10. Bazz: Very small sample size of him having success because of that unfortunate injury this season. Old school scorer to me like Adrian Dantley. Probably too much of a ball stopper, and really bad at defense. Great rebounder for his position. Hope to see him in the starting lineup opposite Wiggins next season. 

Gorgui probably goes around 13-15 Bennett is probably a mid 20s pick. "
"That draft was so bad, hopefully one day it won't be."
"Boooooo Olynyk is trash haha. Other than that I can't really disagree with any of this.

Wondering what you need to see from McLemore to have him in your top ten from that class?"
"The jam, smooth as LaVine behind the back. Tight edit man loved the crash hitting right at the dunk moment for a while there. 

And, I swooned at the look Rubio gave me. I'm just loving the Wolves, can't wait for the next few years."
"McLemore needs to do more than just score on offense. Be a much better defender (seriously he makes Kevin Martin look like Tony Allen on defense). He would also be much better if he would get to the free throw line at a higher rate. "
"I really love the look on Lavine's face @3:48."
"What's odd is that Plumlee actually beat out a few great players to be on the USA basketball team in 2014 (obviously a lot has to do with his style of play and playing for coach K)..."
"He's reliable that's why. Solid on offense and a solid defender. Doesn't try to do too much and gives it his all. Pretty much what you want from a 2nd or 3rd rotation big."
"Nice that's fair. 

Also, after reading your edited post, I just had a 30+ minute conversation with my dad about Adrian Dantley who is not a player I knew much about other than he scored a lot, attempted a ton of free throws, and his teammates hated him. I learned a ton not just about Dantley but other things from that era that I didn't know, so thanks for that."
"Actually it wasn't. It looked bad at the time, but you have four guys from that class (Noel, Giannis, Gobert, Oladipo) who I think will make at least one all star game in their career."
"I will admit that the 2013 draft was an absolute ""shoot from the hip"" kind of draft where you weren't quite sure what kind of player you were going to get. If you were a GM in this draft, odds are high that it was one of the most stressful in years. "
"Yeah we""ll trade you Gorgui for Lebron and a couple draft picks. 
And at times I despise KLove... But at the same time he's the reason we got Wiggy. But either way, you wanted to see what Ky, LB, and KLove could have done in the finals. It seems like every year the champs aren't chosen by who's the best, but rather who stayed healthy and didn't get injured. "
"No Gorgui for you...ever!


I would not take Kevin Love back even with Wiggins on our roster. It sucks he dislocated his shoulder, but to be honest, I chuckled when it happened.  Kind of over him, I feel like he just turned his back on the organization to force his way out, regardless of what Khan did with his contract."
"Man, I was hyperventilating by the end.  Good stuff."
"Thanks for watchin homies   ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
"Wolves fan's opinions of Dieng range from ""biggest disappointment of this season, cut bait now"" to ""starting C for years to come"". 

He has potential but his sophomore year was less encouraging than his rookie year. He struggles on defense and needs to bulk up. For where we drafted him, I'm happy. "
"I'd still take Len over Dieng. I still think he's got some unrealised potential."
"Who's representing the twolves at the lottery?"
"Cool video. Next time crop the video for the cinema aspect ratio, instead of squeezing it. The dudes look fat. "
"I really liked him for a while but I've grown to be disappointed by him. He seems like a really hard worker and good guy, but he's not the right body for a quality NBA starter. He's too short to truly play center, but doesn't have the skills to play PF. He was getting a lot of blocks for a while but now everybody seems to have figured him out. He tries to time his jumps to get blocks rather than using length and it's stopped working for the most part. This results in a lot of fouls or easy buckets. He's not a liability on defense, but he's not much help lots of times either. On offense he's middle of the pack. His post moves have improved but his height is still a liability in a league where most teams have a 6'11"" or taller Center. 

IMO he'll make a good backup center for his career but will never be good enough to be a quality starter on a good team. "
"Man, not going to lie, this is one of my favorite videos to come out of this season. Great choice of music, and the edits fit perfectly.

That Rubio face at the end is killer hahaha"
"[deleted]"
"Wow Dieng is being undervalued. He's better than Olynyk and Len lmfao.  He's with Adams and ahead of Plumlee.

You know Adams and Plumlee have faults too right?  You understand Dieng's scoring efficiency is solid and his defense is ""not jumping at ball fakes"" and better positioning away from being very good. Anyone who thinks he's not getting better has zero concept of bigs in the NBA as many of them develop into their late 20s.  Especially when they are as raw as Dieng was at 19.

Only in Minnesota do people hate their own players more than everyone else."
"6'10"" barefoot/6'11"" in shoes with a 7'3.5 wingspan and a 9'3.5"" standing reach is clearly above average for a center. Not too short.

.573 TS% with a good midrange shot and a good not great post scoring game is a lot better than middle of the pack. Middle of the pack on offense for a center is not that good, most centers are not that good.

Dieng had 32 blocks in March in 15 games. That isn't ""*He was getting a lot of blocks for a while but now everybody seems to have figured him out.*""  You are right that he needs to learn how to use length and positioning more and jump less but that's actually not that big a deal.  Bigs develop a lot longer than guards. He's had a year and a half in the NBA.  Give him time."
"Porter is the next Paul Pierce? "
"I'm pretty irrational about the guy since he was one of my favorite players in college and going into the draft that year. Realistically he never gets close to that level but in my opinion his game looks very similar to Pierce.  "
"I love gorgui, you know he was still going to U of L possibly might still be."
"Thanks for giving me stats and not being too mad at me for being a Cavs fan. Obligatory fuck Kelly olynyk and Joakim Noah. I hope gorgui continues to play well for y'all. "
"He was my gorgui first. "
"I really like K Love for what he brings to the team. I've always been a KLove fan. But I feel like his leaving was justified, 8 years in the league and never been to the offs not even first round. Your front office made no attempt to give him any help, why would you stay in an unsuccessful environment? You can't have Bron. He's home and never leaving again. "
"&gt; Your front office made no attempt to give him any help, why would you stay in an unsuccessful environment?

Yeah... okay.  I suppose the front office planned on our entire roster being injured for 2 straight seasons as well.  We had a playoff capable roster, things just never worked out because everyone was injured for lengthy periods of time.  Even KLove took himself out for an entire season when our roster was looking nice.  Hardly the FO's fault man.  KLove got impatient and that's fine.. but the roster was easily playoff-tier quality in the West if we had been 80% strength even once over the last 3 seasons. "
"If KLove wanted back in after this season via free agency you wouldn't want him back?  That's ridiculous.  As a Wolves fan you've seen what he's capable of.  Pair him with an elite defensive C like we could get in the draft and an elite defensive wing in Wiggy and PG in Rubio.. we'd be playoff ready immediately."
"seriously, isn't he also one of these guys who didn't start playing basketball until he was in eighth grade? I don't understand why so many wolves fans are so off on him, yet somehow cool with rubio's development over his nba tenure. I know it's a different position but Dieng's potential and dedication both seem clear from my perspective. I'm excited to see what he has in store. Love that mid range elbow shot of his too. "
"None of that matters. Never made the playoffs in 8 years. "
"And blaming it on the front office alone is delusional."
"What kind of argument are you trying to make here?"
"Yes?"
"Knuckle pushups the year we actually had a shot for the 8 seed."
"Oh the suspense!"
"Not that this will change your opinion but Love only gave 6 years, not 8. 2 more attempts at it would have been nice, especially with the injuries. "
"Anyone else going to the lottery party at Target Center? "
"He didn't play organized basketball until 17. They had a court he played on (not like a US court which actually teaches you some skills) but whatev.  It's not just the Dennis Rodman/Jermain O'Neal/Hassan Whiteside types that develop late into stars. There are a ton of solid journeyman bigs that were just not good enough to play significant minutes in the NBA until they were 26-30 and then became solid role players as starters or bench bigs.

A lot of big develop later. It's always been that way."
"The big critique on him is valid. He doesn't play defense right and goes for the block way too much. But he's a good rebounder, a solid offensive role player, and has the tools and the work ethic to become a very good defender.

I think people are just reactionary because of his age, but whatev. He's ridiculously athletic and should improve with a good defensive/big man coach.

Here's hoping anyway.

And you're welcome."
"I've been impressed by Dieng. I feel like if he bulks up a bit more he could be dominant. although incrementaly and with more minutes, almost all of Dieng's stats rose last season. 
 Rubio shot 35%FG and 25%3PT this past season, both the worst of his career in their respective categories. When defenders don't respect his shot he loses some of his ball movement potential. Rubio also seems to consistently fall victim to 'freak accidents', idk some people choose to refer to it as 'injury prone'. Call it what you will. 
I guess I'm trying to present my inability to understand why people are so ready to trade Dieng, yet all hyped on rubio still, as though he is an immobile piece. "
"Dominant seems like a stretch. Gorgui seems like an efficient low-volume scorer who doesn't really have any moves and gets pushed around a lot in the paint. For someone who is 26 it's a bit unrealistic to assume he'll be able to bulk up much more or develop those skills too much further. I love him as a nice backup center.

Rubio's shot receives too much criticism, IMO. He doesn't shoot much per game and does everything else well, he more than makes up for lack of scoring. ""Consistently injured"" is too harsh considering he's really only been injured twice. His slow recovery speaks more about the training staff than him being injury-prone."

"He has potential. I could see it in college. 
And apparently he graduated from Louisville yesterday. 
http://www.cardchronicle.com/2015/5/11/8586769/gorgui-dieng-gets-his-u-of-l-degree"
"I love Gorgui's hustle, range, defensive upside, and character. On a contender he'd be an elite 8th man/backup C. At this point, however, he has no business starting for any team with aspirations, because he's too much of a tweener size-wise, and he still needs some polish. If the Wolves get KAT, Gorgui will be in a perfect position to succeed.

Fuck Kevin Love. I love that trading him landed us Wiggins, and that's the only positive thing I can say about him. He was trying to leave from the moment he put up his first 20-10 season. He was a shitty locker room leader, and never seemed too invested in being a part of anything long-term here (although David Kahn deserves some/most of the blame). On top of that, he's a fucking dumpster fire on defense, has zero inside game on a team that has smaller players (i.e. Kyrie, LeBron) that can get to the hole, and has just looked lost all year. 

With all that in mind, his injury actually opened the door for my best-case scenario this season. I'm a huge LeBron fan, and I hate Love. The way I wanted this season to go was the Cavs win it all without Love meaningfully contributing. I wholeheartedly thank Olynyk for making my dream possible."
"If the Bazz/Sauce Castillo swap has to happen then its a no go. Trading Bazz is not in our favor right now, we're trying to open up minutes for him, not get rid of him."
"im already sure we will be drafting 4 and porzingis or 3 and okafor"
"And if we pick 3rd it will be the largest mass suicide party of all time."
"Not necessarily, LA and NY have established fan bases and established history of success. I think if there is any rigging or anything like that it'd actually be more beneficial to have the Wolves become successful. Not only would you be putting talent around one of the best young players currently in the league, you'd be reviving what has been proven during the KG days to be a good basketball market which would benefit the NBA. "
"#3 doesnt mean we lose out. If philly lands above us, they dont need okafor/towns probably grab Russell. Plus, if the big men are gone at #3,  Russell would be a nice pick, even if we need a center more. "
"This is cool, I hope he can finally live up to some of his potential but weight doesn't matter if he still goes out there looking lost and half assing it."
"What about when we pick at 4? :("
"See you there! "
"There is zero chance of us taking Porzingis with our pick. "
"Then, we get down on our knees with an offering to the basketball gods hoping some incompetent team passes on one of them. "
"It has been said before, but Philly will most likely grab the best available. If Towns/Okafor is available at 3 for them they would most likely take them as both seem to be ranked above Russell by nearly everybody."

"It's not about odds. It's a given the Knicks or Lakers will get 1, maybe even 1 and 2.

The fix is in."
"Yes. I understand that, and I am saying there's no chance of it happening. 

Any interest we have in him is likely if we miss out on Towns and Okafor, wed take somebody else with our pick and then trade with SAC or someone for Porzingis. "

"Wow at first I was like ""this guy is nice"" then after reading these last two comments you seem like an ignorant douche lol"

"Pordingus"
"In Flip's exit interview he said he was fine with wherever the Wolves could end up 1-4 because at least one of the guys he liked would be available there. The beat writers have made it clear that Porzingis is a guy Flip really likes. Flip is comfortable with picking Porzingis in the top 4 spots. You should get comfortable with the idea of the Wolves getting Porzingis with either the 3rd or 4th pick. "
"And my previous comment still applies. "
"How do you know there is no chance of that happening? Are you more clued in to the Wolves than the guys that work and report on the team daily? "
"Lol I clicked on that and didn't see the comment box and thought I had been banned for some reason"
"What are you basing this off of?"
"It's not 2001 bad which people were saying at the time."
"It's just kind of how he handled his last year and him leaving. I guess I can't blame him it would get frustrating losing over and over. He just didn't seem to appreciate anything the wolves did for him over the years. "
"I'm scared."
"thank god we never ended up with waiters "
"He put up 25/12 and worked his hardest his last year. He did the job he was contracted to do. Not being a dick but would you stay with a losing team if you had the chance to gtfo?"
"Dwight was the most recent, right?"
"Yeah. The year before Cleveland won with the best odds as well, though they were also tied with Denver for the best odds for number 1 and Denver ended up with #3.

"KG didn't want out, Love is a big baby.   Apples and Oranges.  "
"If the Wolves are picking 4th and Okafor/Towns/Russell are off the board then the Wolves will pick Porzingis. It really doesn't matter if Porzingis isn't a top 4 pick to you, reports are Flip sees him as a top 4 pick then the Wolves will pick him top 4. "
"Very fortunate of us that Cleveland got that 1st pick luck.  Their luck = Flip flipping a sweet deal"
"No. That's what I'm saying. If the Wolves are picking 4th and Okafor/Towns/Russell are off the board, the Wolves will not pick Porzingis. "
"Based on what? You're opinion of what the Wolves should do in such a situation? Legit beatwriters are saying that in such a situation Flip is taking Porzingis, they are much more clued into the thinking of the Wolves than we are. "
"Yes. Legit beat writers have never been wrong before, and professional sports teams never employ the use of smokescreens."
"Wolves don't use smokescreens. Shit we knew they were going to pick LaVine like 2 weeks before the draft. Wolves are a pretty transparent club when it comes to the draft. "
"I imagine one of two possibilities that night:

1) The Cavaliers make a block-buster trade, sending Kevin Love to the OKC Thunder for their 1st round draft pick and (with a 0.5% chance) miraculously get the #1 pick.

2) It's down to us and the Knicks, Silver clears his throat and says, ""And the #1 pick in the 2015 draft goes to..."" All the sudden the lights dim, and someone short walks in front of the cameras. It's Dan Gilbert's son. He walks towards Silver, flicks a lit cigarette in his eye, grabs the microphone, and says ""the Cleveland Cavaliers."" He does a microphone drop and, just before walking away, tells Flip that his wife tastes like Chaw. 

tl;dr: I have zero confidence that we get the #1 pick, and I believe the Cavs will somehow get another #1 pick. "

"I might disagree. I personally think that the one that we should pursue is Scott Brooks. Only because he is good at developing young talent, he did one hell of a job with Durant, as well as Westbrook. I think he should hire Brooks for a short two year contract at the very least because I think that he can be very helpful in developing Wiggins and lavine but I could be wrong"

Edit: nvm, I guess drafts were created for all 30 teams. #4 pick confirmed."

Also, If we get 3rd pick in the draft, and the two bigs are gone, grab russel, trade martin and payne for a decent 4, sign bonner, put russel at the 2 with lavine you have:

Rubio/Brown-Lavine/Russel-Wiggins/Bazz-Bennet/player-bonner/Gorgui

"An NBA team starting LaVine, Bennett, and Matt Bonner. We'd set the record for most losses."
"Towns. Best player, fits the Wolves biggest need, would be really fun to watch him and Rubio run a pick and roll. His already great ability plus learning under KG he could be nurtured into one of the most dominant big men in the NBA for the future. "
"Yeah I tend to lean towards Towns as well, I feel like the fact that he's an 80% free throw shooter get overlooked a lot too. Just hard cause Jahlil's post moves are so damn beautiful. "
"Towns but not by much over Okafor. 

I think Okafor is going to be a top 5 low post player the day he walks into the NBA. 

Towns is just a better all around prospect. "
"Don't fuck this up sugar tits. "
"&gt; Let's say we get pick #3

I'd probably shoot myself. "
"You're thinking of Eugene Levy. "
"Could still potentially get Okafor at 3. "
"Was hoping for Marney Gellner, this is a close second."
"I like this Porzingis guy from Europe. He seems like hes a real good player. "
"Never heard of him, not a fan of taking risks on overseas players who aren't playing against top competition. He top 4 pick worthy? "
"For the most part European leagues have better competition than college. Porzingis for instance played in the Spanish ACB largely considered the second best league in the world. "
"Definitely Towns. He clearly has the all around talent to be another star for the Wolves. While Okafor depends highly on post looks for his offense, Towns has shown that he has the range necessary to score from midrange while wings like Shabazz and Wig can post up. Being very nimble, he would be an excellent roll man for Ricky. This being said if the Wolves were willing to trade the pick to another team, I would say that WCS is the best option."
"Yeah completely different game overseas though, rarely do you see players come from overseas and become a star in the NBA. "
"Fingers crossed for Porzingis!"
"Conference finals 2018 is my prediction. "
"stop"
"Would be pretty sad to see them trade back for WCS, has the ability to become and elite defender in the NBA and I'm pretty confident he will be, but at the moment we need more than a one way center that provides little on the offensive end. "
"If only slick rick were our GM we'd have 2 first round picks every year"
"Not really. The NBA is moving more toward the European style of play. "
"I seriously love that woman 😍"
"Not really "
"Everyone is copying the Spurs, the Spurs run a Euro offense. Their lead assistant is literally one of the best euro coaches ever. The pick and roll sets everyone stole from D'Antoni are European. Only awful offensive teams like the Wolves,  Knicks, and Lakers are running traditional heavy iso classic American systems. "
"D'Antoni hasn't had a drop of success in the league for a decade now. Not quite sold on the notion that the NBA is converting towards the Euro style of play, and if that was the case we would see more Europeans having success in the NBA. "
"D'Antoni's pick and roll sets are a part of the offense of every good offensive team. His influence is still felt. Bruh the Spurs won a title last year running a heavy Euro influenced play style. Stretch bigs are the wave of the future in the NBA most of that is because of the European basketball influence. Yeah Americans still dominate the league but their style of play is more representative of Euro style of play. The growing trend of a stretch big looks more  like a classic Euro big than the traditional American style counterpart."
"Exactly. It's a bit like Wiggins vs Parker debate from last year. Really a win-win."
"As long as we pick KAT, Okafor or Russell I'm satisfied. "
"Wolves are more likely to get 3rd or 4th than they are to get 1st or 2nd. The math is literally right in front of you"
"Well there's that and also the fact that we had the worst record in the league and trading back is not what you should do in that situation "
"It's rigged so..."
"Watch the cavs still get #1 somehow"
"&gt;  it would be very foolish of the league to let our Fanbase shrink anymore than it has in it has.

Relative to the importance of the NY/LA markets, the League has essentially no reason at all to be concerned about the health of our market. 

&gt; The people on this sub Account for a large percentage of the remaining true fans
 
I don't see how this is relevant to anything being discussed, but even so, the truth of that assertion depends on your definition of ""large percentage.""  Is ""1"" considered a large percentage?

&gt; Unless Wiggins is going to pull a full Kevin Garnett and carry the team to the playoffs by himself, there's no way without a number one or two pick that we are getting out of the cellar.

Anything Wiggins may achieve here in MN on his own would be considered a mere windfall to the more highly prioritized coastal markets.  MN getting a 1 or 2 pick would be viewed as a negative in the League Office.

The threshold between a #2 and #3 pick is not life and death.  Russell is a stud and could slide to 3.  Okafor could be a beast and slide to 3.  Even KAT at #1 could end up a disappointment for whoever lands him.  The great unspoken factor in the draft is luck.  If we don't hit on this draft, maybe we'll hit in the next one. 
"
"You can't really actively change injuries.  Not unless you think our training staff is inept, or you believe in God and want to get down on your knees and pray for good health. 

We need to improve in strength, pick and roll defense, post defense, rotational team defense, defensive rebounding, shot selection, ball movement, and overall offensive strategy.

Having a team out on the floor that's not quite so young will help improve all of these areas, but not as much as acquiring a better head coach would. "
"It was more of a hope than I guess a change for the injuries"
"Ah, yeah, I think we all hope for less injuries.  Less injured veterans will make everything look better. "
"1. New coach
2. A defensive big
3. A worthwhile PF

I'd be OK with Flip holding on for another season if no good coaching prospects are available, since we're probably in for another developmental year, but long-term that's a huge hole Wolves needs to fill. A defensive guy like Mike Malone or Thibs would be ideal, but if the best coach on the market is Scott Brooks or someone similar, I'd be happy to kick this can down the road.

Pek is about as useful defensively as Love was, and Gorgui isn't much better, currently. The lack of a credible interior presence on defense has killed the Wolves for ages. The future hinges on the lottery. If we draft anyone besides KAT, we might be doomed to another era of futility even with young talent like Wiggins, Lavine, Bazz, and Gorgui (not to mention Ricky and whatever alternate pick we would end up with).

Finally, even if we get KAT, there still isn't anyone on the roster who would play 4 on a contender. This could be solved by making a few guys play out of position (Pek, Bazz, Gorgui), but it would really help to have a pure 4 for the future. Okafor might solve this problem, but given his current defensive game, he'd just compound our issues on that end."
"This is our destiny."
"I always felt like it was Wiggins vs Embiid, personally.  Parker's obviously also a great prospect but, much like Okafor, he's all about scoring while the other option(s) are more about the all-around game."
"Since the Bucks aren't there, can we borrow Mallory Eden?"
"Kevin Love"
"Dude what is your obsession with Matt Bonner?  He hasn't had a PER north of 12 since the 2011-12 season."
"3% more.  I mean yes greater odds but it is basically a 50/50 shot."
"Comparativly speaking KG played his heart out, Live whined his way out "
"Ok even if it's 50/50, we'd be just as likely to be 3/4 than 1/2. It does not mean the commissioner is out to get us."
"That's a ridiculous thing to claim."
"Oh lord you're serious..."
"thats very true.  Its more of the fact that we have had the worst record before and still got screwed.  
edit:  forgot to say yeah the commissioner is not out to get us"
"This is who i think we should send... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgo9HggL23k  I couldnt find the saying alone so i had to do the animated verson"

"Towns then Russell. Russell reminds me of James Harden although obviously its a slim possibility that he comes close to that. "
"The Cavs? Anthony Davis? You cant be serious...."
"it would be best for the Sixers to get the fourth pick. They dont want to reward the tank."
"We want the #1 pick though not #2. We should kidnap Nick Gilbert and his bow tie to get the #1."
"Hes a signable vet. in a position we need. Seems fine by me
"
"Yeah, I wouldn't be sad if we landed Russell whatsoever, as long as Towns is off of the board by the time we pick. Russell's gotta smooth shot and his passing ability is actually pretty underrated."
"You could make an argument for the lottery being rigged every year and for every team. 

I also don't understand why you would watch something that you believe is against you"
"You do know the lottery draw is monitored by independent auditors and representatives of each team. If the draft was fixed every team that didn't get the #1 would snitch. "
"No, this is so unbelievably naïve "
"Towns. He is imo the best prospect. He stretches the floor and has potential to be an elite shot blocker. Solid FT shooter, and him being taught under KG seems like a solid foundations mentor. Okafor is obviously great offensively in the post, but he cant stretch the floor like Towns does, so Towns gives way more space for Lavine and Wiggins to drive in or use post moves like Wiggins tends to do quite often. "
"I want recovery. If Rubio can stay healthy, and by some miracle Pek gets healthy and stays that way, then I would be happy. We also need a reliable 4 really quite badly."
"Instead they give the Cavs the #1 pick........ "
"Stay and post in your own team's sub if you're going to be a douche"
"He's signable for a reason.  Re-signing Justin Hamilton would be a much, much better option."
"just means 65% for top three"
"we don't mention Pek because between his health issues and his contract there's basically no way we'll be able to trade him without adding something like a future first to the deal while getting basically nothing in return."
"Well in 2k, I drafted Towns and Buddy Hield, traded our 2018 first round pick, this years 2nd round pick (owed to us by sac) and Pekovic for Al Jefferson, and signed Tristan Thompson in free agency. So right now I got

PG - Rubio/LaVine (he plays combo in my offense)

SG - Martin/Hield (hield is returning to Oklahoma so this is pointless)

SF - Wiggins/Muhammad/Budinger

PF - Thompson/KG/Bennett/Payne/Hummel

C - Jefferson/KAT/Dieng (I expect to trade Dieng)


Currently 32-0 and Wiggins is averaging 23.2 ppg. Projected All-Star imo"
"Flip had 2 year one. By the end of the season he had 3 in year 2"
"Only a douche cause y'all were douches first. Read your other subscribers posts too. Someone said he was praising olynyk for injuring Love. That's seriously fucked up."
"Yeah, he has been at the top of draft discussions for months now. Many consider him top 5 worthy, although I don't count myself amongst that crowd. You should recognize his name if you've read any mock drafts, though."
"Typically the worst team in the league is not an attractive landing spot for free agents, no. "
"46.51% for top 2."
"Why is that? "
"So is it safe to assume the franchise is moving toward a navy blue/white (maybe even cream) color scheme?"
"If the sixers drop out of the top 3, they have a better chance of getting the Lakers pick though. "
"Okay, so its just coincidence that the year the NBA is trying to sell the Pelicans, they get the first pick of the draft? I can buy that for sure, things like this happen all the time. But the Cavs have gotten three of the four last picks the years after king james leaves, a less than 1 in 1000 chance? In one of the most talent rich drafts in recent years, the Cavs hopped 13 teams the year his contract ran out? Coincidences dont happen every year, but in the lottery, they do."
"Winslow. I think he's gonna be the best of this draft. 
"
"What are you talking about. Knicks run the triangle and the Lakers run princeton. And while i don't particularly like it Toronto and Cavaliers are some good examples of teams actually having success while running iso-heavy offenses."
"that's almost 50%!"
"So he's coming to play for us right? Please? Pretty please?!"
"Well put my good sir, I agree with you to the full extent"
"If he plays for us next year and we get either Okafor or Towns, then were going to have a pretty good looking roster next year (as long as we can stay healthy)"
"BRING HIM ON OVER, JOIN THE PACK, AWWW YEAHHH"
"I'd love to end up with him and Towns, both are able to operate well outside of the paint which opens it up for Wiggins and Bazz. Defensive potential is there too. It's somewhat realistic but still feels like a pipe dream."
"What's unrealistic about it?  It sounds like we're probably going to sign Bjelica, let's say 60% chance.  And there's a 25% chance we get the number one pick and draft KAT.  

    .60 * .25 = .15

15% odds for the best possible offseason; that's pretty good I'd say."
"Well it's more likely we pick 3rd or 4th than 1st or 2nd, so if that is a ""nightmare"" scenario for you, prepare for the worst. It's the more probable outcome."
"I like our team. If we could add Bjelica and draft an elite big, that'd be excellent for our future. "
"Does anyone know if/when he intends to come play in the NBA?"
"He seems to be. He hired an American agent. Flip went over there to watch him play in the playoffs. All signs pointing to yes, he feels like it's time. He'll probably be looking at a salary in the 6-7m range as a rookie."
"Oh and by the way he was asked by some Greek reporter when they played Panathinaikos Athens if he's going to the Wolves next year (Flip traveling there heated up the rumors some around the league) and he gave a non-answer, ""focused on winning a championship"" type thing. That's his only public comment on it, as far as I know."
"To discourage teams from tanking"
"Exactly, no matter what, we will have to deal with any situation that reveals itself. Stay positive my wolf brothren"
"If he is coming over this year it would be great but if he isn't coming this year, I doubt he is ever coming and Flip would be wise to trade his rights. At 27 years old I wouldn't mind signing him now but the uncertainty of him coming and age along with how fast he would take to the NBA are major concerns going forward."
"Guess they changed it, Glen Taylor will rep the Wolves at the lottery. "
"We still technically have the best chance to get the number one pick. Let's just pretend we don't think it's rigged."
"I admire the lack of sleeves."
"I don't think it's rigged. I don't have to pretend. But I can also add and multiply numbers, which is all it takes to show we're more likely to get the 3rd or 4th pick than a top 2."
"46.51% for 1 or 2.

53.49% for 3 or 4.

It checks out."
"What's his skill set?  More of a Mirotic big or Gasol/Pek?"
"Classic case of ""had a good tournament so his stock skyrocketed"".

You know who we drafted because they had great tournaments? Wes and Flynn. No thank you."
"Hahaha. That's true.

But Winslow was legit even before the tournament. And is young compared to Wed and Flynn when they were drafted. But I certainly understand the hesitation "
"If we pick at four with towns, Okafor, and Russell off the board, and someone wants to trade up a spot out two to grab Mudiay or Winslow, leaving us to still take WCS at 5 or 6, you do it.

This ultimatum about ""we're bad therefore you can't trade back"" is ridiculous.

We were bad two years ago too and we traded back and took Muhammad and Dieng. How did that work out?"
"Uhhhh, there are more and more good Euro players in the league each year.

Hell, a Euro player was a rookie of the year candidate this year. A Euro player hit the game winning shot for Atlanta last night. There are at least two European ex MVPs playing in the league RIGHT NOW. Our best player is European. More Euro players are active right now than at any time in NBA history.

So what were you saying about the European style not being popular in the league?"
"Hahaha broo, all I was saying is that you don't see Europeans come into the NBA and have success at as high of a rates as you see from college kids. Never once did I say they can't be successful in the league, I realize more and more Europeans are making their way into the NBA but it's still dominated by Americans and it's as simple as that. "
"I don't think anyone really knows what his intentions are. Considering he just turned 27 if he does want to play in the NBA it has to be soon. Hopefully winning this award leads him to want to go to the next level."
"I just have the feeling that the only way we end up with KAT is if we get #2 and Okafor goes first, which I don't see happening."
"You must not have watched him during the regular season. Dude is a freak athlete and has developed a nice jumper. Elite defender as well. Although I don't believe he'll be number 1 overall, he'll be top 5. "
"Yeah, but we have a better chance of getting 1st than any other team! 

Think of it like rolling a die. You're more likely to roll either a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 than you are to roll a 6. So if it comes up 6, it's obviously rigged! "
"Does anyone watch Euroleague pretty seriously? I have never watched it. Plus all I have seen is highlights from this guy, not any tape, for those who watch Euroleague extensively and not just mixtapes/highlight reals, what player can he be compared to and what can we expect?

From what I have gathered, he's a shooting 3-4 but he's also 6'10"" and he has gathered some comparisons to Hedo Turkoglu, is this accurate?"
"more like sam dekker"
"Towns for obvious reasons. We need an all star 2 way Big Man. He fits the build and can also provide spacing with his shooting ability.

My favorite player in the draft is Russell though so if Towns were gone already, I would want Russell. He does everything you need out of an NBA guard. Shoot and score from anywhere, dangerous playmaker, and a killer mentality when he's on the floor. 

Our team is not good, so let's also remember we want the BPA. Not looking for need when you're picking as high as we are."
"As a Fenerbahce fan i couldn't be more excited for this guy, I would do anything for him to stay but I am also very grateful for his time with us. Insane hustler, nerves of steel, grabs boards like there is no tomorrow, anything you would want from a player. Best of luck to him."
"That's assuming Towns is Flip's guy.  It's still early but most media seem to link Okafor to Flip.  My bullshit calculations has the scenario at 6%. "
"Just FYI Bjelica and Fenerbahce play tomorrow at 2 pm central vs Real Madrid. Pretty sure it'll be on ESPN3 or another streaming site. Any interest in a game thread for it?"
"I watched all of fenerbahce's euroleague games this year and I can easily say that the biggest quality of this guy is his hustling. He has nerves of steel, good finishing around the rim and good ball handling. He can shoot the occasional 3 but he is not in the same level once hedo was.
Edit:btw i think this guy smiles even less than kawhi leonard."
"Out of curiosity, is anyone here actually subscribed to slam?"
"im assuming we are drafting 3 already"
"What an uncharacteristic move by David Kahn to acquire a player through the draft who doesn't have a thousand watt smile.

"The John Flynn/Mr. Charisma factor.
"
"top 3 would be fine. "
"Lol I love how our wildest dream scenario has us picking at #2. I agree that we won't get the top pick because of basketball reasons but it seems funny as we have the best odds."
"Not a doubt in my mind, we're picking 3rd for sure. "
"We'll see. A 25% chance is still higher than any other team has to get the top pick. I guess I'm still just a bit sore about losing out on the #1 the last time we were in this position and the Cavs moved ahead of us. The tides have turned though."
"[“I’m really eager for this town to get to know Jonny because I think that Jonny has a chance, just because of his innate charisma, to become one of the most popular players to ever play here,” Kahn said. “I really believe that.

"I'm not sold.

We could draft fourth..."
"[deleted]"
"I Agree"
"Kevin who?"
"10/10, would have 4 kids with."
"Thanks for the insight, I am pretty versed in prospect scouting, but mostly at the Highschool/College level. I need to venture into overseas scouting as it is becoming more and more prevalent in todays game."
"While Thibs is a great defensive coach, which the Wolves obviously needs, I think we might suffer having starters play 40+ minutes a game (not ideal for a team with may potential scoring options off the bench). Besides, NOLA might be a more attractive destination for Thibs if he leaves."
"With the reports of New Orleans wanting him, I think he's most likely going to end up there. I'd rather have a college head coach to grow with us, but I wouldn't be upset of we somehow got thibs here."
"Independent auditors that have no legal obligations to truthfully conclude informstion. They are also getting paid to do this and just like ""independent medical examiners"" in law suits, they both are hired by the party that obviously influences a biased conclusion. "
"""Lottery is rigged because the Wolves won"" 

Let me hear your argument."
"No way. New Orleans is a better job for him unfortunately. AD will be a DPOY soon enough"
"Flip said he's coaching next year, so no way. Besides that I think Orlando and New Orleans are actively trying to hire him."
"How does it feel? Fucking amazing! Kevin Love was a cancer, always having an excuse and blaming teammates/management. Even when he was right to complain, doing so to the media to make yourself look better is the opposite of what a leader should do. It made it really hard to root for him, especially after having a superstar with heart and desire like KG. And if you think that our franchise is worse off now than it was a year ago, you're crazy. We were going nowhere fast with Love. "
"I can see why people would prefer Nola over Minny, but Orlando?

Not saying Thibs would come here, but if it were up to me and I'm a HC looking for a job and I have one offer to coach Anthony Davis and another to coach Andrew Wiggins + the potential of Karl-Anthony Town, I'd pick Minny in a heartbeat."
"No income tax and Orlando is willing to give up a second round pick"
"\#TeamScottyBrooks 

I don't understand why no one really wants Brooks.

 He helped developed that young okc team and made them good on defense."
"*MVP"
"Makes me cringe even more that we drafted him over Curry. "
"&gt;I don't understand why no one really wants Brooks.

Because he's a bad coach that didn't have an offensive system outside of ISOing Durant or Westbrook and who continued to play Perkins long after it was obvious that Perkins sucks. "
"Medtronic does a similar thing.  The guys that work at the wolves are great, I play bball with some of them at the Target Center."
"Bulls fan here but I've been following the T-Wolves for a long time too. I don't know if Thibs would be a good coach for this team, honestly.

His rotations have been just awful. As deep of a bench people said the Bulls had/have, he just didn't take advantage of it. The T-Wolves need to avoid that IMO.

Anyways, I look forward to watching your games next season!"
"Jahlil... trade back into the first round and draft Tyus"
"There's an alternate universe out there where Kirby Puckett was a bust and Jonny Flynn is the most popular sports figure in the history of the Twin Cities. "
"Yep"
"I know 2 years from 2 years from now y'all will be good. It's all about potential. You know you guys are the west's version of the Sixer's. "
"I love how redditors think they can easily critique coaches. I'm pretty sure Thibs knows what he's doing"
"If we select him over Russell I will cry. If we fell to 4 and Russell, Okafor, and KAT were gone I would consider picking this kid. It would be between him, Mudiay, and WCS for me. If Flip knows Bjelica is coming over finally I see more need to grab Mudiay than Porzingis."
"Please God no. I don't want him. If we were picking outside the top 10 maybe, but that's it. We don't do well with Euro bigs and usually nobody else does either. Please Flip...don't. "
"Players I'd rather have than Porzingis

-KAT

-Okafor

-Russell

-WCS

-Mudiay

-Winslow

-Stanley Johnson

-Frank the Tank 

-Myles Turner

-Anybody

Then...and only then would I draft Porzingis....maybe. "
"Just a question to all the anti-Porzingis people out there. Have any of you actually watched him play? Scouts are probably high on him for a good reason, and if Flip wants to take a roll on him I wouldn't be mad. He's done pretty well the last two drafts and I'm about 99% percent sure that he would know a hell of a lot more than a bunch of redditors. "
"I'm huge on Frank, really I love the guy. He simply is not a top 4 pick though. If we got the 3rd or 4th pick I wouldn't mind trading back to 10-20 if we got to dump a contract and pick up a good role player. An example would be us trading the 3rd or 4th pick and Budinger or Bennett to the Suns for Alex Lin and 13th pick. I don't know how badly the Suns would want to come up for whichever prospect they favored but unless we get 1 or 2 I'm good with anything Flip does including moving the pick."
"While i'm not completely sold, what I do like about this kid is that we could potentially call him Pordinkus"
"Well he is a bull's fan.. I'm sure he has a general idea of his own coach's strengths and weaknesses."
"Orlando has a nice young core too and they play in the East. With a good coach they could definitely make the playoffs next year. 

We have some nice young talent but the playoffs are a ways away. I don't think a coach like Thibs would prefer to wait."
"I've watched some of his film and he does look impressive. The thing that worries me the most is that 9 our of 10 times the post/bigs game from Europe doesn't translate well into the NBA. The PF/C position in the NBA is a completely differently played position than most other places. Look at international play. We often start a SF at PF and they still dominate other countries PFs because they aren't use to the NBA play-style. Now make them match up with actual PF/C in the NBA and it gets even worse. 

I'm not saying it's impossible for a Euro big to be succesful in the NBA. It just doesn't happen often. There are exceptions every now and then like Dirk and the Gasol brothers. However, I don't want to take the chance on him being like most other Euro bigs and not playing well in the NBA when there are other players who I think have a much higher chance of being stars. 

Before anybody uses Pek as another example don't bother. He was a 2nd round pick, and I still don't think he's a decent NBA player anyway. He can score but he's too much of a liability on defense. A center that can't block shots is close to worthless in my eyes. 

**EDIT: I guess I'm being downvoted but if somebody would like to post something actually proving anything I said wrong I'd love to see it.**"
"&gt; Before anybody uses Pek as another example don't bother. He was a 2nd round pick

Pek was a second round pick for reasons other than talent, iirc.

e: yeah, from his wiki

&gt; Peković was selected 31st overall in the 2008 NBA Draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Many draft experts considered him a top 10 pick, but due to his contract situation with his team in Europe he was selected much lower. He was considered a lock to be drafted with the first pick of the second round because players selected in the second round are not subject to the rookie scale contracts of the first round. This meant that the team that drafted him would be able to pay him more than those players selected later in the first round. Due to the amount of money Peković was making in Europe already, he likely would not have made the jump to the NBA for the amount of money that could be paid to a late first round player. It was reported on June 30, 2010, that Peković had agreed with the Wolves to a 3-year, $13 million gross income deal."
"No most people just don't like Euro bigs because they historically flop a lot. We've all seen his highlight videos, they're amazing, but it's hard for any guy like to him to convince fans he isn't Jan Vesely"
"Well he wasn't and he isn't "
"Which would make it even worse had he gone top 10. For where he was drafted he's done what's expected. If we had drafted him top 10 he's a bust IMO."
"[deleted]"
"I'm basically the conductor of the Pekovic hate-train but you're being ridiculous.  Getting what Pek was able to give the wolves as a second round pick is like winning the lottery."
"What was he able to give us? Just curious. He scores and then lets the other team score on defense. Where he was drafted he did about what is expected. Had he been drafted top 10 there's no way he wouldn't be considered a bust by now. "
"Euro bigs or any other European players don't fail more than any other prospects that enter the draft. Taking a look at international play Team USA doesn't dominate because of their bigs, it dominates because of the guard play. International teams usually shit on USA down low because US bigs tend to on offense only able to catch lobs. Even in the NBA look at the names of the young up and coming bigs [they're not American](https://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-rebirth-of-big-men-a-breakdown-of-old-school-bulk-and-new-era-skill/). "
"If he does well he can be Pordunkis."
"&gt; We don't do well with Euro bigs and usually nobody else does either.

Yeah I mean except for Pau and Marc Gasol, Mirotic, Gobert, Nowitzki, Ilyasova, Gortat, Motiejunas, Vucevic, Gallinari, Kanter, and Valanciunas."
"So why do people want thibs  if you are throwing out a coach because of his offense.

From a development stand point as well Scotty is better that thibs"
"There are 5 names you didn't list for every name you did of Euro bigs who busted. Not gonna argue this point anymore in this topic because clearly nobody agrees with me and that's fine. Just mark my words, in a few years (maybe even next year) I'm gonna come back to this and show you all how right I was about Porzingis being a bust. "
"Jahlil Okafor is a top three pick and his game is literally the same as Pek's."
"Can everybody stop saying Kristaps will 100% be a bust. Just because a lot of Euros do bust doesn't mean that no matter what if Flip decides he wants Porzingis he will literally be Hitler for picking a Euro. I think Flip Saunders and other big name NBA front office employees know a lot more about this than all of you couch GM's so I would stop complaining."
"Only responding to this because it's not about Porzngis anymore. I actually don't like Okafor much. He's #5 on my big board for the Wolves. I agree he's all offense for the most part. However, he is a better passer than Pek and he's more athletic so he has a much better chance at developing some good defense. "
"Yeah I don't think he was making the point that Frank is worth a top 4 pick. He just really doesn't want Porz haha.  
  
But anyway yeah if we end up with the 3th pick I'd be cool with moving back in the scenario you laid out too."
"It's easier to say someone will be a bust because there's far more. Relax. He should at least be able to last in the league because he can shoot the 3."
"Sure am. Been so for 4-something years now"
"The next ideal step for the league is to get Robbie Hummel as much facetime on national TV as possible. That'll only happen if the wolves become good. Wolves will only become good if they get better players.  
  
First pick in the 2015 NBA Draft confirmed."
"How do people feel about Mark Jackson? Either for this team or just in general.  
  
I used to live out in Oakland so I've always been partial to the Warriors (also gives me a team to root for come playoff time). I really liked what Jackson brought to the warriors and really didn't like when he was fired. It obviously worked out, but I still think he is a good coach."
"We should definitely have the guy who danced during KG's return game to be our rep one of these years."
"Didn't Flip say he wanted to coach long term?"
"&gt; Said the head of basketball operations for another team: ""I think he's a lock for the top five and I wouldn't be surprised to see him go as high as top three. He's good. We all like to do our comparables. He's like Dirk Nowitzki or Pau Gasol..... I'd take him ahead of (Jahlil) Okafor.""

100% that's Flip."
"I believe he said he's going to be the coach until he says he's not. He's been pretty vague."
"Towns, then Russell. I'm not high on Okafor at all; he just screams ""bust"" to me. Maybe I'm wrong, and if so I'll just edit this post later a la Chad Ford...

But seriously. If we get Bjelica from Europe at the 4, Towns at the 5...sweet. Bazz at the 3, wiggins in the backcourt with Ricky. That's a sweet lineup, and with a veteran signing or two, this could be a .500 team. "
"Hard to say until we know what's happening elsewhere. 

Is KG staying or not? That's a roster spot. If he stays, and we draft a big, either Dieng or Pek has to move to make room. We can't carry four centers and Dieng is more likely to move than Pek. 

Is Bjelica coming over? That's a roster spot. This is top of everyone's list because he also fits a need. If he doesn't, we need another big. 

Can we trade Martin, Bennett? The first has value to a contender. The second barely has value in the D-League. He's clearly talented but something isn't clicking mentally with him. 

I'd keep Gorgui, Hummel, and Payne for depth. They don't make much and they are solid at what they do. But I recognize that Hummel is expendable, and Gorgui is a trade asset based on skills and good contract. Payne isn't worth much but could play some decent minutes this season. 

Hamilton and Brown are expendable. Sorry, guys. 

We need backup PG depth (if we don't draft a PG); we need a C who can stay healthy and contribute defensively; we need a PF who can stretch the floor and rebound; and we need shooting across the board. "
"You're short-changing him so much, you'd think he raped your sister or something.  To claim that all he does is score is untrue.  He's a great defensive rebounder, he's scored efficiently, and he holds his own in post defense, despite your claim that all centers who don't block shots are worthless.  Gorgui is the one who lets opponents score at will, all while fishing for blocked shots.  Pek rotates and stops penetration in its tracks with his size and strength.  Especially after his first year, when he learned to defend without fouling so damn much. 

The single biggest knock on Pek is his health/availability.  When healthy he was great for us. "
"[deleted]"
"People disagreeing about evaluations isn't necessarily complaining.  ""Flip works in the NBA and so he automatically knows more than you"" is a lame conversation stopper. "
"That sounds like someone who is down on Okafor; Flip loves Okafor. "
"You're right. I have my anti-Pek goggles on. He's not as terrible as I feel like he is sometimes. His ridiculous contract just gives me such a sour taste in my mouth I forget he's pretty good player who just has some flaws. It's not that I don't like him, I think he'd make a great scoring weapon off the bench. It's more that I don't want him starting and his contract kills me. "
"Flip is not the Unquestionable Buddha of Talent Evaluation.  ""Flip had two good drafts, so let's just stop arguing about it and agree with him"" is a conversation stopper.  It's not analysis, it's not interesting; it's just blind homerism. "
"If I'm honest I don't particularly want him. We have a lot of guys who've missed time for injuries dating back before the days of knuckle-pushups, and I worry that Thibs' style of coaching, while its intensity has its merits, could genuinely end the careers of guys like Ricky and Pek who've had injury issues forever.

That, compounded with the fact that we need a lot of ball movement considering the guys we're building a team around, makes him pretty unenticing to me.

That said, we probably couldn't get the guy even if he was a good fit, AD is too tempting for a defensive-minded coach like Thibs."
"Him at number 4 wouldn't be completely awful. I would just choose okafor, towns and russel over him."
"How I see the Brooks hire playing out, worst-case scenario...

ISO Wiggins and (fingers crossed) Towns/Okafor all day every day. Play Pek well beyond his breaking point and refuse to trade his inflated salary. Make the WCF and finals a few times but never win, causing Wiggins to potentially go back to his hometown and Towns/Okafor to consider heading to a big market like LA/NY.

Oh god that's potentially so analogous it scares me. Definitely the darkest timeline for us."
"If (and it's a big if) we play, I'm feeling a Wolves-Bucks matchup as a hopeful preview of the next 5-8 years. That would be so fucking cool idk how I'd react. "

Real Madrid: Jose Calderon"
"Interesting decision to have the MVP come off the bench"
"Fenerbahce has one of the most decorated head coaches in international basketball history in Željko Obradović."
"I think it's because people are throwing the soft label on him. You don't want a soft big man."
"Bjelica is really running the point well, sick pass to get the easy dunk for Vesely. "
"Point forward bitches"
"He's getting some great assists/passes into scoring situations, I hope we bring the guy in."
"Is Real just a collection of old Spanish ex-NBA players? Cause it feels like one"
"Same, would love for Flip to get creative and run some bigger lineups with Bjelica at PG. Create some matchup issues on offense. "
"It's basically the Spanish national team without the Gasol Brothers. "
"Weak call on Bjelica. "

"Anyone know the proper pronunciation of Nemanja Bjelica? I was probably badgering it with Ne-man-ja. But I think it's nee-man-jya or something..."

"But Flip also seems to love Porzingis."
"His 20 minutes in a Euroleague game has proved this!!!"
"Bjelica and Dieng all-time hard-to-pronounce frontcourt"
"I really shouldn't complain though. I'd be happy to get paid at work to watch basketball any day."
"I'm using this as revision procrastination, nothing takes the mind off exams like mediocre basketball"
"Vesely's doing some work for Fenerbahce right now vs. Real tho, he's one of the few reasons they've played something close to actual basketball this game"
"Scorezingis?"
"Nice. Way better than mine."
"This is not the team i watched all year, down by 20 points c'mon guys.I'm really disappointed. Only player playing decent right now is Vesely. Rest of them are just committing turnovers. Eight fucking turnovers to madrid's zero.shit."
"Better in key games Austin Rivers or K.C. Rivers?"
"You're not wrong to be pessimistic tbh but I don't think that's the best argument - I can give you 5 NBA flops from almost anywhere in the world for every NBA success, it's just so unlikely. Our last Euro big pick (Pek) has worked out ok at least.

That said, I agree with you I'd be a lot less happy with him than Towns/Okafor. When you get down to guys like WCS over Porzingis that's when I get a little doubtful though"
"But Doogie says that Okafor is at the top of Flip's board, so he must love him even more.  I doubt he'd denigrate Okafor just to make a point about how much he likes Porzingis.  Therefore, I think the odds are &lt;100% that that's a Flip quote.  It just tells me that Flip isn't the only basketball Head that thinks highly of Porzingis.  Which isn't surprising.  He didn't become a lottery pick based exclusively on the scouting of Chad Ford and Flip Saunders.  Plenty of people like Porzingis. "
"Fenerbahce coming back!"
"I want to believe!!!"
"https://twitter.com/DWolfsonKSTP/status/599211071375708160

Also, there's the cynical angle that this is a shrewd comment by a GM that wants to drive up the value of Porzingis, but has no intention of actually taking him. He only wants Mudiay/Winslow to fall to him at pick 4-8.

"that technical foul was so much bs"
"&gt; and other big name NBA front office employees know a lot more

Like David Kahn did?"
"He was also awful in the NBA, pretty sure he had more personal fouls than points scored in one of his seasons."
"Unfortunate for Bjelica and Fenerbahce. I am calling this gamethread a success though. Will do more here in the future. "
"One dumbass doesn't make you smarter than the entire NBA."
"&gt;Just because a lot of Euros do bust doesn't mean that...

This isn't about Porzingis being from Europe; it's about him genuinely having a huge chance of busting. 

DrKoooolAid is the only person I've seen use the ""Euro"" argument against Porzingis. 

There are legitimate *huge* flaws in Porzingis's game. 

He's too weak.

He doesn't rebound well.

He's not a good defender.

Look at the good bigs in the league are right now. DeAndre Jordan, Dwight Howard, Boogie Cousins, Andre Drummond, etc.  NBA centers today basically need to rebound and block shots, two things Porzingis doesn't do well.

Let's look at some other bigs in the league who are good three point shooters. Dirk, Bargnani, Spencer Hawes, Ryan Anderson, Kevin Love (Also good at rebounding though), Bosh, Channing Frye. Spencer Hawes is the only one in the playoffs now (and Love), and it's because the starting center on their team is a rebounding shot blocker.

There are so many reasons for people not to like Porzingis, and pretty much everyone recognizes that he has the highest chance of busting out of anyone in the top 10 conversation. 


Edit: A 3 pointer instead of a 2 pointer is nice. An offensive rebound and a putback layup/dunk is nicer. Even if Porzingis ends up being the best possible player with his playstyle, I'd rather have someone else."
"&gt;We all like to do our comparables. He's like Dirk Nowitzki or Pau Gasol

Porzingis is a dead ringer for Andrea Bargnani. That is the only comparison that should ever be made. His ceiling is 2010-2011 Bargnani, his floor is 2007-2008 Bargnani. 

(Bargnani's stats were better in Europe though)

Edit: thanks whoever downvoted this. Give me one trait of Porzingis that is closer to Dirk than it is to Bargnani.

You guys can't be serious. "
"It's odd that we are the odds on favorite to get the number 1 pick but we are also most likely going to get the 4th pick.  I don't know what to think."
"At least ""Towns"" is as easy as it gets "
"I never trust ""he's soft"" in pre-draft analysis, especially for players who haven't been seen much on national US television.  

Whenever a media analyst expresses concern that a big European player might be ""soft"", as often as not it's because the writer is being lazy and probably a little bit racist.
"
"You're probably getting doused in haterade because your opinion of European bigs is about ten years out of date.  There are several perennial championship contenders these days who would not even be in the discussion if it wasn't for the contributions of their Euro bigs."
"This might be a better question to ask /r/nba but I posted here because it's relevant to our interests right now, as there's a non-zero chance we miss out on the first two picks but then get ""lucky"" and snag the third."
"I could see either Philly or Sacramento taking Russell over Okafor"
"I agree. I think if we get the 3rd pick, we'll likely end up with Okafor. It would, of course, depend on the order, but there are teams that would probably take Mudiay or Russell 1 or 2. 

Both of them dropping? Probably not."
"I posted a version of this question over on /r/nba to see what reactions would be there.

A lot of posts patronizingly explaining the ""BPA"" draft philosophy to me, but through the crap-flood I see there are a couple other teams where their fans think they might go for Russell over Okafor.

Nobody I've heard from thus far said they would pass over Towns though."
"Yeah, and Towns appears to be the guy who will absolutely not drop.  He might not go #1, but he definitely will not go #3 or lower."
"&gt; He's too weak.
&gt; He doesn't rebound well.
&gt; He's not a good defender.

And...

He has no post game.

His BBIQ and awareness is spotty.

He averages less than 1 assist per 40 minutes pace adjusted in the ACB. "
"I think we mostly stand pat in FA this Summer unless for some reason Flip decides to ship out Martin or Pek.

We've suddenly got some pretty good horses.  We just need to work on getting them to run together well.

The one exception being at the 4.  If we don't fetch a big in the draft I don't feel great about starting Payne or AB.  Having 15-20 minutes of KG is great, but we need somebody we can count on for big minutes there.  Or at least another 20."
"It will never happen, but I would literally pee from laughter if it did."
"Nope. There's a slim chance that NY takes Okafor first, but that's it.

I think a lot of teams will opt to trade down or draft Russell/Mudiay second though, so that gives us a bigger chance of nabbing Okafor, who I think we'll try to end up with unless we get the first pick."
"Couldn't we dig up a kid with cancer or something? Call Make a Wish Foundation... It'd be a sure win."
"I'd primarily like to change/improve the W/L record. Secondary to that, better nacho cheese in the walking tacos. Not that it's bad, I just want better."

"
"Everyone but Flip knows that 3 pointers are part of a modern NBA offense."
"Man that's a pretty crazy coincidence "
"....and ricky? cmon bruh"
"Ricky really gets a marginal role on the national team because the coach for the national team sucks. "
"What if Flip pulls a Wittman? Mediocre season with complaints about too many long 2's. Somehow makes the playoffs. Playoff Flip is a thing, we actually shoot threes, lose to the Spurs in the second round."
"how many times am i gonna see this argument on this sub today? jesus christ. so should we just never have discussion then cuz ""NBA guy probably knows more than us cuz hes in the NBA"""
"Flip has to be as good of a defensive coach as Wittman is in the first place. Randy is an awful offensive coach but he at least he knows how to organize a defense. Flip can't even do that right. "
"the dreaaaaam"
"Yeah, I think Flip is hopeless on defense. But isnt he a bit decent on offfense though? "
"Look, Flip deserves *a lot* of shit for his weird, anti-3-ball attitude...but he's also trying to instill good discipline into these young guys, not letting Andrew and Zach settle for stupid 3's.  (Zach still needs work to do)"
"Exactly.  Also, go ahead *and check out who's guarding him in those highlight videos* then get back to me"
"He was back in the day when running a play for a long 2 was an acceptable decision.  Nowadays that is an awful conclusion and playing right into the hands of opposing defenses. 

"
"So basically, he looked like a good offensive coach just because KG was money from midrange?"
"Fuck that. Flip is awful. He is saying 3s are bad but taking long 2s are acceptable outcomes which is even worse. The guy refuses to run plays for 3 pointers. He's out of touch and his play calling is absolute shit."
"Basically. He tried to run the same sets with Payne and Bennett instead of KG and we've seen the terrible results.  There are some good play sets within his Hawk Offense system that result in favorable match ups in isolation situations but contemporary NBA offenses only take those plays instead trying to shoehorn an entire philosophy from the 80s into new a new millennium league."
"I should also note that Wittman and Flip run the same offense except in the playoffs the Wizards inexplicably took more 3 pointers which ended up with better results than their standard offense. Running a lame style offense is still bad compared to a well rounded playbook but you can tweak the system to fit the style of play that is effective today.  Flip seems unwilling to do that though which is awful and should be fireable."
"At top 4? Oh man, that would be a terrible pick. He'll be a late lottery or early non-lottery guy at best. I'd love to take a chance on him if we somehow traded for a relatively late or mid first rounder, but not with our top 4 pick.

Getting kicked out of two programs is a serious thing and the guy can't shoot free throws and doesn't have much of a post game, he's also already 21. Seems like he could be an excellent defender and a solid guy to get putbacks, dunks and lobs, but that's if he gets his issues sorted, and who knows if that'll happen.

EDIT: Your comparison to Whiteside is very apt, but if I was drafting Whiteside and I knew it'd take him years of being out of the league to somewhat humble himself and actually be an NBA player, I wouldn't go near him in the top 10."
"I compiled most of the information off of Draftexpress.com and the nba combine."
"I was back in the day.  I remember getting Slam issues reading about Vince Carter up in Toronto.  "
"Wow that picture is bad ass...."
"It's only an interview and a very casual 5v5 workout but dude is looking good. It also seems like he understands his problems, and wants to play NBA ball. These could also be lies and he could end up as the NBA JaMarcus Russel but less hyped. 

I know he doesn't really fit in our situation(top 4) but, I just really wanted to write about this topic for some reason.

[Interview/Workout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dAgVV0fm30)"
"To be blunt it would be fucking retarded for a team to take a guy with that much risk and not enough talent to back it up in the top 5."
"I don't blame you, mate. Prospects with the physical tools he has and who manage 7 blocks per 40 are really enticing, but with a top 4 pick we don't really want to take a guy who's such a question mark.

I'd actually really like to have him on our team, but I don't know if we could figure out a trade and his stock is everywhere at the moment. He could just as easily go late in the lottery as easily as he could drop low in the first round or even to the second."
"If we get so unlucky as to fall to 4 and draft this guy I wouldn't be mad. If we passed on Towns for him I would be furious. Personally I value WCS Okafor Russel Towns and Kaminsky over him. (Not that I would take Kaminsky at 4 but I would take Russel and attempt to trade up and pick him for our big in this draft) But theres always the chance hes the next Dirk. His game is very similar. I just don't think the kid fits our teams needs. Wiggins Lavine Bazz should be the guys taking shots next year. I really just want a defense minded big to go along with Dieng, Payne, and KG. "
"I keep imagining the ping pong balls floating around in that container and getting bigger and bigger until they break out.  Then they move around the room faster and faster until they are lethal and take out everyone in the room.  Then it is announced that we got the 4th pick and I sob and scream uncontrollably."
"You mean the same coach who told people to let players go instead of contesting shots. That defensive coach? Wittman?"
"The same coach that has coached 3 consecutive top 10 defenses."
"&gt;  not letting Andrew and Zach settle for stupid 3's. 

And he would be applauded for that if he wasn't letting them settle for stupid long 2's (a much worse shot) instead. "
"I could also see the Lakers going for Russell or Mudiay over Okafor. They need a PG, and an Okofar-Randle frontcourt would be a mess defensively. "
"He never implied we should take him top-5.

&gt;We should grab him if he falls late or by trading back into the first.

Which is very fair. Flip has said we aren't using both first rounders so a trade up is almost guaranteed."
"I coach a basketball team with a lot of young players. It's obviously a whole different level, but getting players to understand what is a good shot and when you should take it can be a struggle. Our philosophy (which I'm sure is similar to Flip's) is to take open shots, not to force shots that are only ""good"" because it's worth an extra point. As ZaidSabr said, getting players disciplined and understanding the game is way more important at this time. A guy like Kevin Martin was shooting all the 3s he wanted but coaching Wiggins or LaVine to do the same wouldn't be good."
"Ohhhh didn't catch that, but personally I wouldn't touch him with a 10 foot pole until the late second. He has serious character issues, a questionable work ethic, and didn't dominate nearly as much as he should have being an athletic 7 footer that is already 21."
"Now that I'm on my computer I see it's edited so maybe it wasn't there when you commented. 

After reading the OP it seems like this dude needs a badass and defensive savvy coach, which Flip is not. I'd probably rather use the seconds for a backup point guard/euro stashes. "
"Yea I'd much rather go the PG/euro route with the seconds."
"Thank god. I would take KAT over every prospect. we need the d more than okafor's offense "
"Do the right thing and take KAT. "
"Are we all possibly overrating KAT because he's ""new,"" and Okafor at this point seems boring? Fans do have a tendency to do that, whether it's sports or politics or movies or TV. Okafor's name has been mentioned countless times over the past couple years, while KAT has only come on in in the past six months.

Not saying that IS what's happening – just curious if Okafor fatigue is making us underrate him, and overrate KAT."
"No, we are not. KAT had numbers comparable to players like Duncan and Davis at the same age. "
"Like everyone else, I want KAT. 

But Flip's basketball IQ is higher than mine, so whoever he picks, I'm sure it'll be the right move given the information he has."
"This is a great post, no idea why people are being so negative"
"Happy that KAT has finally moved up in Flip's mind.  

Based on this cool [NCAA player comparison tool](https://laynevashro.shinyapps.io/comps/) Towns' top 5 comps are:  
'95 Tim Duncan  
'07 Greg Oden  
'96 Tim Duncan  
'92 Greg Ostertag  
'08 Robin Lopez  

Okafor's on the other hand are:  
'93 Bryant Reeves  
'93 Chris Webber  
'01 Zach Randolph  
'05 Andrew Bogut  
'94 Clifford Rozier  

Now all the Wolves need to do is win the lottery and create the next great guard/center duo. "
"I think this is absolutely what is happening"
"I just don't think advanced metrics are good enough in basketball for this to be a serious tool. I'm not sure they can ever get there because basketball is too dynamic"
"""Independent auditors that have no legal obligations to truthfully conclude informstion."" 

You're delusional. Those auditors (Ernst &amp; Young) certify the books of aprox. 1/5 of public corporations world wide. If they were found complicit in rigging something as inconsequential as the NBA draft, every corporate audit they sign their name to would come into question. Their reputation as a firm would fall apart. Google Enron if you'd like a textbook example of this. "
"This isn't even advance metrics. It's standard boxscore stats plus some advanced shooting percentage stats mixed with some physical measurements, age, and strength of schedule. "
"Why is Jerry Zgoda telling us about the feelings coming from his gut when he's got actual NBA sources feeding him real information that contradicts it?  If your most trusted source can be confused by indigestion, maybe just keep it to yourself. 

At this point, based on where we land, this is who I think we'll get:

1. KAT
2. Okafor
3. Okafor
4. Porzingis

Which slightly pains me, because I really want Russell.  Although Okafor has enough strengths that I'm not going to be depressed if we pick him. "
"Just to get the semantics out of the way, when I say advanced I mean anything that doesn't show up in a box score (% of shots assisted etc)

Excepting the non-basketball measurements, all of the things in that slider aren't good enough. They just don't tell enough of the story. I think eye test discussions are more useful. I don't think something that compares zbo and bogut really tells us anything about the players"
"Those % of assists and % of shots at the rim are tracked though. It didn't come out of thin air.   
  
The comparison of Bogut and Zbo basically mean Okafor is a player that primarily scores down low in the paint and is really bad at protecting the rim.   

Eye test discussions suck because a lot of the time 1 attribute will decide a comparison. Like in December Okafor was compared to Duncan because of his advanced low post scoring repertoire even though outside of that one attribute Duncan and Okafor are not similar at all.  

I think part of the reason you don't like it is because it makes Okafor look like shit and articulates in reality how awful he is on defense. "
"I think KAT make the most sense, since it fits a huge need defensively. But Okafor is so highly regarded, I wouldn't be horrendously disappointed if that's who Flip went with.

But we'll see!"
"I think it's worth asking, even if it is or isn't happening. There's a reason people seem to love Okafor."
"~~His post suggests taking him in the second or trading up to the late first. Nowhere did he say top 4.~~

Classic OP, editing his post."
"Bogut's turned himself into a decent defender, to be fair. Not elite, but he isn't a Pek-like turnstile. Players can improve on that over time with good coaching/work ethic. "
"Well I'm glad Zgoda never knows shit haha"
"&gt; KAT because he's ""new,""

KAT isn't new. People have been talking him up since he was 16 and playing against Team USA. "
"I live in Seattle and watched him play regularly and actually attended a UW game. Dude is a BEAST! Blocks for dayzzzzzz. 

That being said, he was kicked off the team and disciplined. I don't know if his upside is worth having him in the locker room. I wouldn't take the risk. Let's go get Towns!"
"Is this where canis gets their comp stuff?  It's neat,  but I don't think they mean anything.  They trotted out Wiggins comps trying to tear him down predraft and they did the same to Klay Thompson with pro comps when Wolves fans were hoping he'd be a key piece to a Love deal.  

Wolves luck into Wiggins and Thompson becomes a sure fire all-star, they don't bring up average player comps and plateaus as much.  

Plus look at how different each of those players are for each group. "
"Yeah, I'd say bogut is ""decent""

Bogut is 3rd in the league protecting the rim of players that face more than 4 attempts a game behind Ibaka and Gobert."
"I mean...his post skills are highly regarded. His defense is a huge question mark and he is a horrible shooter. 

I don't know how much you are following the draft but Towns is far and away the top prospect by any respected outlet. Okafor is in the running for second but if we don't draft Towns at one it'll be an embarrassment and we will come to regret it. "
"I prefer KAT but honestly Okafor's comparisons are a little better overall I'd say haha."
"Bogut certainly is elite, but is the exception in this regard. "
"It's zgoda... Everyone.  The least connected beat writer in sports"
"I watched both teams all season and I still think Okafor should go first. I guess I have gone crazy"
"Maybe this guy would pan out, but I would bet a lot of money that it won't be with the team that takes a chance on him first. The thing with these immature, high-risk guys they typically burn several bridges before maturing and actually helping a team, pretty much like Beasley and Whiteside did."
"Nope. Okafor went into the season the #1 overall, and nothing really happened to make him drop. He won freshman of the year and helped duke win the championship. 

The reasons Towns seems to have taken over the top spot are potential and his playstyle."
"I feel like Towns's defense is massively overrated too. That Kentucky team was absurdly stacked with length and depth. "
"His stats are definitely padded a little bit, but I think Towns is a better defender than WCS. 

I don't trust the stats, but from watching him he's really good."
"He edited his post, it was originally about grabbing him with the top 4 pick. I would take him with a late first or early second at the drop of a hat."
"Philly wants a guard"
"Kahn isn't drafting. Flip has not been picking duds.

Trey Burke was the obvious pick, Flip can evaluate talent."
"Confirmed: If the Wolves win the lottery they will either take the 1st or 2nd best prospect.

Thanks Jerry
"
"&gt;Aw, but I want Porzingis at 1

Said no one ever, and thank god.

Edit: Kristaps, no offense if you're reading this. "
"If we pull a khan move and draft a PG for some reason. I will explode."
"Give me D'lo"
"Our sub needs more quality OC like this. Nice work!"
"Is this even remotely a possibility?"
"No because Flip won't give up his coaching spot. "
"Don't see the differences. Okafor's comps are all are good offensive players bad defensive players, where as Towns has players that were good/great on both sides of the floor. "
"That's the key. He's not running plays for threes. He's running plays for long twos. I don't care what he encourages or discourages verbally: his plays don't set people up for threes. "
"You don't see the differences between Duncan,  Ostertag, and Lopez and then Webber, Bogut, and Randolph? They could all be their own category of player. 

Certainly not as black and white as you and these comps are making it.  "
"&gt; and nothing really happened to make him drop.

Except that his defense, rebounding, and effort level got exposed, and he showed that he struggles some scoring against Bigs with NBA size. "
"Not really, they all are pretty much the same archetype with varying degrees of success. The Duncan, Ostertag, and Lopez group rep the good offense great defense bigs while the Webber, Bogut, Randolph group is the great offense terrible defense bigs. The value box at the end of each comp merits the classic rich mans X poor mans y comparisons. "
"Yeah,  but they all got from ""point a"" to ""point b"" in vastly different ways, in different roles, and with different body types. 

Something that puts Duncan,  Ostertag, and Towns together then Webber, Reeves, and Okafor together definitely isn't comparing apples to apples. They're just different players regardless if their output is similar."
"Yes, and despite that, he was still the best freshman in college basketball."
"Also he is not very good with dealing with young players and doesn't work with rookies well"
"WCS is the consolation for #4 IMO. He might be at the Tristan Thompson level."
"no"
"You're delusional if you even consider comparing those two situations. Enron completely changed the accounting field. "
"They're tracked but they don't tell you anything about the quality of the defense on those shots or any other number of variables that could give a meaningful window into what's happening on the court. If those kinds of stats are the best we've got, they're just not more valuable than eye-test analysis by people who know far better than you or me"
"It's what Zgoda heard some talent scouts say they *think* Flip will do if he wins the lottery. That's hearsay of speculation on a hypothetical situation. Followed by Zgoda's personal speculation on a hypothetical situation. "
"It's a winning tweet.  I think we will be drafting a player who has two feet and a healthy skin tone.  I read somewhere that we were going to draft a player alive.  I hope we can do it!  Retweet me.  Start a reddit thread about what I said."
"We get 3"
"To expound, I think NY and LA get 1 &amp; 2"
"Interesting. Any reason why? Also, who would Minnesota pick at 3?"
"First time I've tried making one of these, let me know what you think!"
"We're getting #1, THIS IS OUR YEAR!!!! "
"May the odds be ever in our favor..... But maybe with all this scrutiny about a conspiracy going on the men upstairs will just give us the pick to shut everyone up."
"Idk if that's true... Was trading for Payne the best move?"
"Yeah there's no way the commish allows our small market team jump over the possibility to have a superstar in LA or NY"
"History is why."
"Interesting, I think they might give it to Orlando actually, and then NY and LA get 2nd and 3rd, with MIN getting 4th 

"
"4th pick. Not because it's rigged, not because luck hates Minnesota, but because we are statistically most likely to get the 4th pick."
"4 because Timberwolves."
"We'll know in about four years when we see how both Payne and the pick we traded for him turn out."
"I'd be SHOCKED if NY or LA didn't get the 1st overall.

EDIT: do people honestly think one of these 2 will not or what?"
"We have a 65% chance to get a pick higher than 4."
"As terrible as our records have been. Zero number one picks "
"That's true too"
"2 because no one else has picked that yet."
"Great work man. I'm so hyped to see what he can do with this young squad for the next few years. "
"Dude, this was awesome! The beginning was especially cool. I think I need to do some more video editing to make stuff like this. Great work!"
"Thanks! I just tried to throw something together, and now I think I might want to start working on my next one."
"I'm working on a video for Shabazz because I want people outside of /r/Timberwolves to know how great he is. It's still a work in progress ;)"
"It's gonna be great... Can't wait for next season to start."
"You better post it here when it's done."
" #2. Some team in the 6-9 range will get the number 1 (I have a hunch that it'll be Sacramento, no real reason just a feeling I get when thinking about it). Wolves will get #2 and take Okafor.  

 Also I see a lot of talk about conspiracy of Knicks or the Lakers getting the #1 don't sleep on Miami making a huge jump in the lottery Pat Riley is like a mafia king he gets what he wants. "
"I have a gut feeling we'll pick top 4 guys"
"I'm just not a fan of conspiracy theories. "
"I am fairly sure that we'll get the third or fourth pick, with NY or LA getting number one and a team with a slim chance making it into the top three, like the Hornets or something. "
"Is there any reason to believe they won't receive it? I don't even think it's a conspiracy theory at this point, teams that will benefit the league the most financially by getting the #1 overall almost always receives it."
"One year, there was a hot college superstar forward who was confidently projected at #2 overall (some even said #1), and everyone agreed that the talent pool was a steep drop after that the Wolves basically had a choice between him and a European big that some scouts were excited about, and the choice was plainly obvious.

The Wolves went with the consensus pick they were supposed to take, the college superstar.

And that's the year we chose Derrick Williams over Enes Kanter, and everybody breathed a sigh of relief that Kahn didn't screw up the pick.

Now I'm not saying; I'm just sayin'."
"Interesting, I see no chance that Sacramento moves up.

Denver and Orlando however..."
"How did the Magic winning the lottery 3 times benefit the league? I mean Milwaukee won the lottery in '05 with the Knicks, Lakers, and Clippers in the lottery. Shit, the Lakers and Celtics were in the lottery last year you don't think the league would have benefited greater financially if Wiggins/Parker/Embiid would have gone there instead of Cleveland, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia? "
"&gt;almost always

I'm only talking top pick as well. Last year with the potential return of Lebron it made a ton of financial sense to give Cleveland the top pick. In '05 Milwaukee did win but the other teams you mentioned were fairly far down the totem pole for draft order and that's the reason I clarified that it doesn't ALWAYS go to the teams with the most financial benefit."
"No you're grasping for straws because you're made up conspiracy is bullshit.   

Here's some facts for you. The lottery draw is done in front independent auditors and representatives of each team in the lottery. What is the point for teams that go into the lottery every year and lose every season to go along with the gifting of top players to these hand picked teams? Why would teams like Minnesota and Sacramento go along with this conspiracy year after year while they both lose on the court and bleed money every year? "
"We have a 75% chance to get a pick lower than 1."
"I don't think there is a need to get aggressive here, we just have different views on the topic. I wouldn't necessairily call it a ""made up bullshit"" conspiracy either a lot of people believe the lottery is tipped in favor for certain teams. To go with your second point the league has revenue sharing so I think the teams would not have much of a say in the matter either as long as the league benefits from the results overall. But hey who knows apparently I'm just grasping for straws on something I've thought about a lot."
"Touché "
"http://i.imgur.com/EfvfrV9.jpg?1"
"Where's the evidence? Most conspiracy's have evidence. The only evidence the NBA lottery is rigged is because certain teams won. The league does have revenue sharing but bad teams still lose money. The Wolves haven't turned a profit in years which is bad for the league. The conspiracy is made up bullshit. It's a lottery don't think about it that much otherwise you just start connecting random dots together even though there is no actual connection. "
"I thought the point of conspiracies was that there is not much solid evidence? I'm not a conspiracy theorist haha I just think that the whole process is too undercover. Like I said the reason I personally believe it is because of the revenue sharing, which benefits all teams and it'll benefit them the most if teams like the Knicks and Lakers win the lottery. I don't think this is random dot connecting, with revenue sharing all teams benefit more from media juggernauts competing. Until the lottery is drawn publicly I will be skeptical of the results, and it's a theory for a reason many people just think the whole ordeal is too shady."
"&gt; a lot of people believe the lottery is tipped in favor for certain teams.

A lot of people believe a lot of dumb crap. "
"True. I wouldn't consider myself a dumb person but the whole ordeal is very under wraps and hidden when there is no reason for it to be. If they want to stop people from criticism and theories they just need to hold it to the public, end of story right there."
"Again, the lottery isn't drawn publicly because it'd be hilariously bad television. You wait for the balls to swing around in a little room with a bunch of men in suits and wait for the combination to call you out in order of the first pick to the third pick and then that's it. It's boring, it's anticlimactic and no one would really care about it. There's a reason why the drawings are done the way they are now.

If you really want to watch it, the drawings themselves are available on youtube and I think on nba.com, as well as a detailed outline of how the lottery process is done.

There's a lot of evidence that the Ewing draft was rigged, for example, that's what a conspiracy is. Saying the draft is rigged now because the ping pong balls simply haven't favoured our team is just daft."
"I'm gonna be honest here, how is that any different from the showings on TV right now? Showing it live would certainly make it more interesting so you can see the results unfold right there. Regardless I think it is bad TV but people will watch because of the draft coverage.

Alright now I think I'm just getting downvoted out of spite ಠ_ಠ "
"Perfect."
"Hawks because I hate all the other teams..."
"That doesn't change the fact that our most likely outcome is still four."
"Truuuuuuu"
"Hawks for champs. Shows what a good coach can do to a team."
"Hawks and dubs. Big Curry fan and I have been riding the Hawks train all season so my roommates will give me shit if they lose (I also have $10 riding on them)."
"Fourth. It's the highest chance and the Twolves always seem to get fucked in the lottery. Although I think it'd be great for the league if they get 1 and can snag Towns to pair with Wiggins - 2 budding superstars for a historically shitty franchise that I think most NBA fans want to see have some success."
"I'd guess LA gets 1, wolves 2, NY 3. They can't give us the top pick can they?"
"I'd be surprised if we did get it haha as long as we get a top 3 pick I'm good I just way KAT, Okafor, or Russell."
"Rockets, that beard is sexy. Curry's beard is gross."
"Flip would probably take Kristaps. I'd take Winslow. Trading down for WCS is fine, but I don't want Tyus Jones. "
"Houston because I like Cory Brewer, and I would like to see the runner up in the MVP race beat the winner's team.  Ant then I want the Hawks to beat the Cavz and then the Rockets to win it all."
"This is the most compelling reason I've read so far. "
"I like Winslow too, but he's not a very high need position for us right now. I really don't want Porzingis, so many of those international stretch guys seem to bust and I can see him getting bullied all over on defense. It was disappointing to hear that he shot up Flip's board on his recent scouting trip. I don't blame you for disliking Tyus - I really just want him because of the hometown boy factor.

Edit: spelling Porzingis is hard"
"Flip traded Trey Burke for Shabazz and Dieng, both of which are better players.  He likely didn't scout the Euros then, and missed out on better players.  If he's scouting Euros and deciding they are great, I'm betting he's right.

He was GM when we scouted KG too. He knows what he's doing."
"Wiggins and LeBron went to CLEVELAND.  
Duncan went to San Antonio.  
Don't even start on Orlando.  
In what delusional world have large market teams been luckier than small and mid market teams?  You tin hat wearing dofuses, it's not rigged."
"Rockets cause Corey Brewer.

I would like the Hawks to win it all though, but a part of me wants to root for our GM LeBron James."
"I'm going #1. Then we'll have 3 #1 overall picks in a row on our team.  That'll be a fun fact."
"KG was pretty much a slam dunk, to be fair. That being said I haven't watched film on Porzingis outside of the 10 minute draft express video and I recognize that I'm not as good of a talent evaluator as NBA scouts or Flip. Just speaking my mind as a fan"
"Cavs. I'm down to see lebron get more rings so my boss will have an anyursym  (he's a big mj fan)."
"Bullshit. If KG was a slam dunk he wouldn't have been called a reach at #5. Lying about revisionist history is still lying, and makes anything else you have to say worthless.

Say you don't know if you don't know, don't just make up lies."
"Awesome comp dude, I don't know if it was on my end or not but the volume seemed a little low."
"2nd - my gut feeling is so strong I can practically guarantee it.  So start getting used to Okafor people.  "
"The reason he was called a ""reach"" was because his body of work was constrained to high school competition and it was an era where 2-4 years of college was the norm, but that doesn't change the fact that he was one of the best high-school players of all time. I would agree that Flip had no small role with evaluating his maturity and (un)likelyhood of busting, but KG wasn't a huge risk for any GM with confidence in his coach's ability to develop talent."
"The future is looking bright my fellow wolves! "
"Cavaliers"
"Winslow or trade. Draft TYUS"
"My site is currently a work in progress, but I would love to hear what people think in regards to the article, as well as the site itself. Both positive and negative feedback are welcome!"
"I'm already willing to say it was a bad move. 

Payne is already 24. The same subreddit that thinks Gorgui has reached his ceiling at 25 years old thinks Adreian Payne can improve tremendously. I think they can both improve, but some people want to have it both ways. 

To me, Payne doesn't show that much potential. He played with a lot of energy and hustle, which was refreshing to see in a lost season, but in terms of BBIQ and skill level, he's not even close to being decent. 

In terms of the pick conveyed: If we make the playoffs, we give the Hawks our first round pick, which will likely be more valuable than Payne was last season and the coming season. If we don't make the playoffs, we give them two second round picks. Payne is likely better than those picks, BUT that would mean we didn't make the playoffs, which is bad."
"3 player draft?  we will pick 4th."
"Flip making one good trade does not make him infallible, and it certainly has no bearing on the value of Kristaps Porzingis.

Furthermore, Kevin McHale was POBO when we drafted KG. He gets most, if not all of the credit, not Flip.  Not that one draft pick could possibly make Kevin McHale infallible either. "
"Warriors. They were the best in the regular season and they currently have the most talent on their active roster.  I like seeing the best team win.  Plus they play beautiful team-basketball.  May the Spurs Style reign supreme and purge Hero Ball from the NBA, for good."
"I want the Warriors, but to see Kevin Love get a ring while knowing he didn't deserve it would be fantastic."
"Lol that would be great. "
"He made more than one good trade.  
He made more than one good draft choice.  
And it's intellectually lazy to exaggerate that to ""Flip is infallible"" as your main counter argument.  You're not an idiot, you know that isn't even remotely close to what I said. "
"&gt; He made more than one good trade.
&gt; He made more than one good draft choice.

I agree.  I was going off of your original argument that 'the Burke trade was good, so whatever Flip wants to do this year must be good as well.'  That's the only transaction you brought up. 

&gt; And it's intellectually lazy to say the least to exaggerate that to ""Flip is infallible"" as your main counter argument.

That's not a counter argument of mine, it's a pithy summation of your original argument. That's all I could find.  Highlighting merely Flips' good moves, and using them to claim that: whatever he wants to do in the future (in this case, drafting Porzingis), is probably correct.

"ok"
"Anyone have suggestions for me to improve?"
"I guarantee we get #2. Obviously we need and should take KAT or Okafor as we need help at that position...but I do think Russell is the next Kobe Bryant. He'll end up on LA and dominate for the next 20 years. You heard it here first...PaPam!!!"
"Three, and Okafor.

Edit: and Okafor will say ""It feels great man"" during the interview after we draft him."
"touch-e"
"Based on the percentages listed, there is a chance. Since the probability of them getting #1 is .063, it is not unlikely since it is over .05 probability."
"I love Russel. He should be our pick if OKA/KAT are off the board. If we get kristaps/winslow over him Ill seppuku. "
"I was of the mindset that Okafor was #2 for us regardless but after watching him in the tourney I just can't go with us taking him if we get #2. He does one thing fantastically but everything else about his game is average at best. Russell does everything well. He got 20-5-5 in college. I was of the mindset that we needed to draft for need but Russell has changed my mind on that. He is IMO the best player in this draft and I hope we get him. KAT has the most upside but Russell will be a solid NBA player at the worst. I'm just hoping we get a top 3 pick and we get one of those three instead of settling for Mudiay."
"Your username is coreybrewersgoat but you aren't rooting for his team?!?!"
"Lol the CVS closed? Calm down bud"
"Whoever wins the West. I really enjoy watching the Warriors and Rockets play. "
"His goat isn't on the team, or I would be rooting for HOU. I'm a fan of the goat, not him. "
"I really like the idea of WCS on this team. I like Tyus too, but I do not want to make some huge deal about getting him here. If it works, great, but I do not want to start dealing any of our young players just to land him."
"Let me clarify. There is a statistical chance that Sacramento can become the first pick. Everyone has seen the lottery odds and knows this to be true. However, I personally cannot imagine Sacramento getting the 1st pick. "
"Honestly don't care who wins the finals as long as it's  not the Cavs. I don't like Dan Gilbert.
I don't want Love to be carried to a ring.

I would like to see GSW beat the Cavs for the championship. Also really looking forward to Harden vs. Curry in the battle of the MVP's."
"I agree. I hate Dan Gilbert too. It might be kind of funny to see Love win a ring that he doesn't deserve though. "
"I disagree about Russell, but good work Nate.  I actually didn't know you wrote too the last time we chatted.  Always great to get some well thought out OC from a dedicated fan!

Good luck with the site!"
"Fuck... What if we get #4.  [I'm so scared](https://youtu.be/bflYjF90t7c)"
"There are right now 3 players that I would be way to pumped about getting.  jesus so amped for the lotto, please basketball gods, please give us a future hall of famer."
"I feel like thats what happened draft night 2009... and when we drafted wes johnson with boogie still on the board.  I wouldnt be too pissed if we got three.  Im kinda in the group that wants pick 1 or 3.  Either we get the hopefully best player or we get the leftovers of the top 3."
"Mudiay has never seemed like a good pick for us, and can't really be considered BPA at any of our slots. *Maybe* fourth, I guess?"
"Thanks Joe! I haven't written much in the past in regards to sports, but I have always wanted to. Anything in particular you don't like about Russell?"
"I like every team that isnt Cleveland.  I do thank them for Andrew wiggins though. "
"[deleted]"
"Well, keep at it!  It's tough to get thoughts down clearly and concisely when you have to deal with both the tangible and the abstract, like you have to when writing about sports.  You're doing great at it, especially if this is your first article (I'm not sure if it is...  I hadn't seen anything on social media or here by you before though).

As for Russell...  We pretty much have a few vast fundamental differences haha.  There are a ton of things I question about him, and you brought up a few of them.  It would take quite a few words to articulate my position, plus I've already decided to write an article about him if the Wolves are in position to take him in the lottery (I'd say 3 or 4—seems like Flip still really likes Okafor).  I'd really have to watch some more tape and do some more research to confidently assert what I think about him though.

Let's just hope you nab \#1 and we get KAT though haha"
"how is this being downvoted?  There is nothing more magnificent, magical, and manly than a big bushy man beard.  If a beard has motivated you to cheer for a team then that beard's owner should be proud and you should be proud of being a man.  Minnesota is a great place for beards and this downvoting saddens me."
"Houston and Cleveland. I know people love to shit on LeBron, but damn do I love that dude. And Houston because of Corey "
"idk I dont see Kobe at all in his game.  russel is a great passer with great vision.  Yes he is a good shooter but besides his intangables(i dont know that part about russels game) he reminds me of a hybrid of curry and harden.  I agree if you mean future all star, for me the kid seems to have it."
"I had a dream we got the 2nd pick.  I would love big KAT, Okafor, or Russel.  So I wouldnt be upset if we got it."
"This actually is my first article! Over the course of the season, there have been multiple occasions where I have had an idea for an article in my head, but this is the first time I have digitally put pen to paper. I appreciate you saying that, because it definitely is an interesting process to try and balance the objective with the subjective. I'm sure it will come more naturally as I begin to write more.

Understandable. Like I said in my article – Towns is by far the best option for the Wolves if they get the #1 pick. I have never really been a fan of Okafor for some reason. I wouldn't necessarily be upset if we take him between 2-4, but I just don't think that he is what the Wolves need. I currently have a ""conspiracy theory"" that Flip is using his interest in Okafor as a smokescreen for something else... I'm not sure what that ""something else"" is quite yet, but Flip always seems to have something up his sleeve.

Russell is obviously going to have negative aspects – just like anyone his age does – but I honestly think there is something special about him. There's just something about him that intrigues me. He's the type of player that has had me sitting up on the edge of my couch watching an OSU game like a kid waiting to open his presents on Christmas morning, just waiting to see what was going to happen next. Steph Curry is one of the only other players that has given me that type of gut-feeling, which is sort of where I got the inspiration for the article. I have watched hours of video on him: high-school, aau, and college tape, various interviews, other random videos on youtube, and there hasn't been anything yet that has raised a red-flag for me. He carries himself well, the people around him radiate positive things about him, and as a Wolves ticket holder, he is definitely someone I would love to see in person for 41 games a year.

Obviously these are just my opinions, and I love that people can have such vastly different opinions about these specific aspects of sports. I would love to see what you have to say about him if you end up writing that. I know you're a WCS fan, but would you take him if the Wolves have a pick at 3 or 4? I like WCS, but I can't see us taking him above 4 at the very highest. I'd certainly take him before Kristaps.
"
"I agree. The idea of taking Kristaps when we might finally be getting Bjelica this year has me wanting to pull my hair out."
"If we take Mudiay, it basically means that we are going to either trade him, or Rubio. It just doesn't make sense to have them both on the roster, so I don't think it will happen."
"I feel the same way.  "
"[deleted]"
"I speak the truth."
"Is anyone else secretly hoping we get the 3rd pick so we have to take Russell.  It's a strange feeling.  I wouldn't complain if we get 1 or 2 by any means, but I think Russell's game translates to where the NBA is trending towards.  "
"Going in with low expectations (3rd) so Worst case is not that much worse (4th) and anything better (1st or 2nd) feels like a blessing passed down from up above"
"lebrah"
"How many players who are bad at defense but have ""potential"" to get better actually get there?  Honest question, because it seems to me that playing good/great defense is a skill that players always just have coming out of college, it isn't something that can be learned in the NBA.  With hard work a player will maybe move up one step, or two in a best case scenario, on my made up chart: Terrible-Awful-Bad-Below Average-Average-Above Average-Good-Great-Elite, but I can't think of any players who have done more than that.

To actually sort of answer your question, I think KG will try to help as much as KAT/Okafor are willing to learn, but they need to want to put the work in for it to mean anything.  I don't know anything about either of their work efforts, but I can't recall anything overly negative so I'm sure if KG wants to help they'll be willing to listen/learn."
"Have any of our players noticeably improved since Garnett came? Not trying to ask a rhetorical question, genuinely curious cos I wasn't really looking out for it during the season"
"Hoping for a Houston/Atlanta finals.  Houston because of Brewer mostly, and I like watching Atlanta play.  I've always like Kyle Korver and Dennis Schröder is one of my favorite young players."
"[Pretty much this.](http://i.imgur.com/AdiBPrO.jpg)"
"Ah, you are a troll.  On multiple forums."
"I would be really shocked if Flip didn't take KAT."
"Not really sure how over a .05 chance is 'not unlikely'. Sacramento's odds at #1 are the same as flipping tails 4 times in a row, where our odds at #1 are the same as flipping tails just twice in a row. Still not betting odds, but have my fingers crossed."
"In statistics, having over a .05 probability is considered not unlikely. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"
"I get what you're saying. Given that the significance level is .05, you're totally right. Which it almost always is, if not lower."
"Well considering he was only with us for the last 2 months of the season plus he was too hurt to play, no. Give them an offseason, training camp, and a ton more practices and KG will have an affect on these guys. Everyone who has played with KG had said he is the best teammate they have ever had. He will mentor these guys in a lot of ways and having him on this roster is a very good thing"
"I mean. Look at some of the players in the NBA. Harden, D-Green-Curry-Butler. Some of them were notorious for not playing defense at all. And now they are all pretty solid defenders. So i think that it can be taught, they just have to realize that it is in my opinion the most important part of basketball; and is necessary to win"
"I just don't understand how so many people here love Pek, but don't like Okafor. 
People will argue that Pek is an okay defender, but then Okafor, who could easily learn to play defense the same way Pek does while being better offensively, isn't worth our pick because of his defense. "
"Porzingis. I kinda like the kid. He does have potential. and he is really tall skinny and has a decent shot. Kind of like KG (I think, im too young for the KG era). I think KG would be a solid mentor for him as well, he just needs to bulk up"
"This was valid response, Nerlins and Mirotic were the other two rookies in legitimate contention for Rookie of the Year due to their play since the all-star break. There was a lot of media chatter that one of them might steal it, and although Wiggins won by a landslide, Mirotic got a handful of #1 votes. I didn't say that I thought either of them deserved it or would get it over Wiggins. This is helping me realize that you don't take NBA discussions very seriously

EDIT: Ah, and I see you took the time to downvote every comment that I bothered to go back and look at, so thanks for that"
"The huge difference between Porzingis and KG is Porzingis is getting all sorts of shit for being a bitch on defense, whereas KG is one of the best defenders of all time. Their stretch game is sort of similar and he does have great defensive potential due to his length but he'll really have to bulk up."
"I really don't like this draft. There is no for sure thing. All of theses players have faults."
"figured as much. Besides the Pan Am/FIBA games with wiggins &amp; AB, any other chances to see some wolves play before next season?"
"If anything there are too many riches to choose from.  Good problem to have."
"I've actually had that thought many times. Russel looks like a star in the making."
"Most of the ones from last year aren't worth seeing anyways. I'm sure LaVine and Bazz will play some pro ams this Summer but everyone else was either hurt or not worth watching."
"I have the exact opposite feeling towards the finals lol. I love all the teams but the hawks. "
"What are Russell's and Towns' faults that you think could make them bust?"
"Even though he was consistently improving throughout the season, I think Wiggins def. got a killer instinct in him once KG arrived.  Felt like his intensity went up, he was attacking the rim more, he was speaking out on the court more."
"I like D'Angelo Russell. But if you look at his performance against teams with NBA caliber guys in the front line he really struggled.

Vs. Louisville (Harrell)   6-20-17 points-6 rbs-6 ass- 4 turnovers

vs. UNC (Jackson, Meeks) 4-17-11 points- 8 rbs- 5 ass- 2 turnovers 

vs. Wisc (Kaminsky, Hayes, Dekker) 7-18-17 points-1 rebound-5 assists-5 turnovers

vs. Arizona (RHJ, S. Johnson, Ashley, Tarz) 3-19- 9 points- 7 rbs- 6 assists- 1 turnover


These were the games he played teams with NBA 1st round picks in on their frontline and he really seemed to struggle to finish in these games.  He is already a savvy player, but of the games he scored 20+ points in they came against Sacred Heart, Campbell, NC A&amp;T, Wright State, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa, Northwester, Purdue x 2, Penn State x 2, and VCU.   Not very many big time performances against the top competition, but not sure if thats a big indicator of bad things to come.  
"
"Warriors-Cavs would make for excellent television. Best player vs Best team. Not to mention the potential wizardry of a Kyrie vs Curry matchup. Unbelievable story lines here, too good to pass up."
"You can love Pek and still not want to pick a player like him first overall."
"I love K-Mart and his shot, but with the team the way it is right now I'd take just about any trade offer we get for him as long as it doesn't come with a big contract. We are a young team with some great up and coming stars. Any big contracts such as K-Mart or Pek's are ones I'd like to get rid of.

I'd really like to see him go to a contender and light it up in the playoffs. "
"Houston for sure. Nothing against GS. I just love Harden. I've always liked him and this year he lead me to FantasyBBall glory so that made me like him even more. Fear the beard! 

Also go Hawks because fuck K-Love (even though he's not playing)"
"James Harden did"
"About 7:30 central time on ESPN."
"Depends on your definition of bust, first of all.  But Towns has a bit to go on offense, and if he basically becomes a slightly better Omer Asik then you could argue that he's a bust as the #1 pick.

Russell's athleticism and defense have been called into question, so if he can't adjust to the speed of the game he could just become a Lou Williams type guy, high energy and can pour in points when he's on, but otherwise a liability.  Again, probably a solid player, but at the top of the draft that's still kind of a bust."
"Isn't Harden's defense thought of as being not good the last couple seasons?  Like I know he had the reputation as a real good defender in OKC but all I've seen about his D lately is that it's fallen way off."
"http://regressing.deadspin.com/chart-of-james-hardens-defense-looks-just-as-bad-as-you-1687812356"
"Me too but the question asked about what happens if we don't pick first."
"1) http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=jwsr9z9


2) http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=km77t7z 


- If the Knicks are seriously trying to pursue Rondo, either deal would make sense for them  

- Clips get a veteran with a more consistent shot

- We get a vet backup PG, and someone Rubio would look up to"
"Cry inconsolably? "
"Well obviously, I was just trying to...

...yeah, I was an asshole and didn't read the whole post, my bad."
"I honestly want to know why there is always a ""Trade/Get rid of Kevin Martin.  You can't start all youngsters and expect good things.  You need those vets to be there.  This isn't NBA 2k whatever.  Keeping chemistry with players is a real thing.  You trade away someone who is helping someone out (a young guy), even if it's the most miniscule way, it will probably affect him more negatively than not.  Now I realize he isn't part of the 'future' sometimes the future doesn't pan out like you hope.  See all the injuries last year.  Kmart is consummate professional and at times played phenomenal.  "
"That chart's from 13-14 season."
"This is actually a pretty good point. His contract isn't the greatest but if he can help some of our younger guys with their 3-point shot that would be extremely helpful. "
"I'm so tired of these ""trade Kmart"" comments and threads. The guy is a great locker room guy that can still score at a very good level. He has not complained once about being here and his cap hit of $7 million isn't a big issue. He is a professional who does nothing but work his ass off. We do not need a roster full of 20-25 year olds. We need some vets and him along with KG are great mentors. Trying to squeeze every drop of trade value out of someone for late picks and a few million on the cap when we all know no big free agents are coming to Minnesota just doesn't make sense. "
"No way jose"
"we have 2 guys who are better/more important in wiggins and shabazz.  And another high potential player at the same position.  Not to mention would could potentially get a nice piece for him."
"I like to equate it to, this isn't a video game.  These are real people who work unbelievably hard.  For those who just willy nilly want to move someone around like that, I can't stand it."
"Yeah and with little purpose at that. Oh we get ""blah blah below average assets"". We are going to have 10 players under the age of 25 when the season starts, I think we will be good on young players."
"still relevant, he hasn't played good defense since he left OKC"
"Judging Okafor solely off the tournament isn't fair though. He averaged 17 and 8.5 on 66% shooting in arguably the best conference. If you only watched him in the NCAA tournament, you missed out on an absolutely dominant regular season. I don't completely disagree with you though. I would love to have Russell if it works out that way. "
"Cavs, because I'm a not part of the most mainstream bandwagon in the league which is people who hate on LBJ for no apparent reason (yes I'm aware I'll probably get downvoted for that statement). Just appreciate great all around basketball, and would love to see LeBron put the team on his back. Although I don't see anyone taking down Golden State and would be fine with them winning too!"
"Steph curry over everything "
"Will it be on the radio?"
"Maybe, it's not really an event for the radio. I'm sure they'll announce the order in the very least. "
"No, I didn't."
"Yes, i understand the need for a veteran presence, but do you really need one that shoots 20 shots a game? Although he is a veteran he also has almost no playoff experience.  He seems more interested in personal stats than team success.  Leaving the Thunder for MN adds to that.  "
"1. DeAndre Jordan (Dream come true he is the best C in the league right now IMO.)

2. Marc Gasol (Second best C in the NBA currently. Great chemistry with Rubio.)

3. LMA (One of the best PF in the league, would love to have him.)

4. Brooke Lopez (Great all around C. )

5. Robin Lopez (Cheaper but not quite as good as Brook, same skill set for the most part)

6. Tyson Chandler (Getting old, but if we could get him cheap I'd take him.)

That's my wishlist. Of that entire list the only one I think we have any chance at or who I'd be willing to pay what they will demand in the market is Robin Lopez...maybe.

"
"Why do you think Deandre is the best center in the league?  He can't hit free throws, all he can do is dunk. His defense  is overrated and he's a major liability for fouls. Marc Gasol is better than him, even Dwight."
"Only rookie to receive unanimous vote for first-team.

Howl."
"http://lmgtfy.com/?q=What+time+is+the+nba+draft+lottery"
"the chart is from 2013-14 data... when he probably didn't try as a defender... He was 6th in the league in steals this year behind only Leonard, Westbrook, Allen, Curry, and Paul... I think the truth of the matter is that he never was really that bad of a defender, but he has become a very good perimeter defender, but he struggles defending on the low block."
"His contract is perfect."
"I just like how he plays. I personally don't think a center needs to make many more shots other than dunks and close layups. In my eyes a good center plays good defense which I'm going to disagree with you on and say he is a great defender. They have a high shooting % as a results of only taking shots close to the basket/dunking, and they can at least run the court decently. I can get over his poor FT shooting because his other attributes are so great.

Not saying Mark isn't also a great center. DeAndre is just more my preferred center of the two. "
"&gt;  I think the truth of the matter is that he never was really that bad of a defender, but he has become a very good perimeter defender

So you're saying he went from ""Average"" to ""Good"" then?  As in, two steps on the make believe chart?"
"It's not terrible, but for what we get/have gotten out of him I feel like he's been overpaid. "
"He doesn't take 20 shots per game, he takes about 12. What other scoring options did we have last year outside of Wiggins? He had to take those shots when he played because no one else was going to be a viable scoring option. This is Andrew Wiggins's team and everyone understands that including Martin. He shot 40% from three and if he stays with us he will probably come off the bench with Zach as a one two scoring combo which is something we desperately need. Trading Martin has no benefit, he is worth more to us than anyone else in the league which is why no one is going to give up any good assets for him."
"Yay Zach made second team!

"
"If we get Russell I'd target WCS and have Wiggins, Lavine, Russell, and WCS as our core four going forward.

Trade assets to go up and get WCS, Gorgui, Shabazz, K-mart, Bjelica, 2 high 2nd rounders"
"No, i think he is a very good defender and before he was average. I think the reason his around the rim stats were not as good this year is because he was trying to stay out of foul trouble and that he was missing key interior defenders for solid portions of the season"
"""very good"" isn't a spot on my chart though"
"Well he's averaged 15 and 16 shots the past two years.  Ideally the team would play Wiggins like 35 minutes a game, Shabazz 30, and Lavine 25 ish at the two and three.  So even if 15 of the minutes of Lavine are at backup PG, that only leaves like 20 minutes a game for K-Mart to be on the court.  If they are able to move him for a big man that can shoot the 3 (Patrick Patterson shot 38% on threes for the year) I think they do that.  



Look at how the Thunder developed.  When Durant was in his 2nd year and  Westbrook and Ibaka were rookies their veteran leaders were Malik Rose, Joe Smith.  Then the next year they added Kevin Ollie and Etan Thomas as their veterans and saw their wins change from 23 to 50.   I think the most important part of the veteran on a young developing team is teaching them how to live and act like a pro basketball player, not exactly taking minutes and shots away from the guys who are developing.  

I feel like if we can sign a back pg like Kirk Hinrich, Steve Blake, Beno Udrith could do a fine job of being the veteran presence and teaching our players how to act while not creating a logjam at the 2-3 position."
"I would rather keep Bazz and Gorgui than trade either for WCS."
"I'm not saying it makes him suddenly more worth it, but he was our leading scorer. "
"Fifth or Sixth, I think they're going to trade back if they don't get #1 and take the best player left from their board (probably Porz)."
"Wiggins and LaVine aren't Durant and Westbrook. We do not have a big like Ibaka as of yet. These comparisons make no sense. Durant came out of college as a scoring machine, Wiggins still needs to develop into a natural scorer. Martin took 15  shots a couple years back when he was still a primary scoring option. Age and injuries have gotten to him and he won't be playing 25+ minutes next year, he'll play 18-22 minutes maybe less if Zach is hot. God forbid we have some insurance in case someone goes down. I think people are forgetting how we had Corey Brewer playing point guard for us in December. Eliminating our depth because he might take ""minutes and shots away from the guys who are developing"" makes zero sense and is why it won't happen."
"A more realistic guy I think would be an interesting addition would be Jeff Withey.  He is a legit 7 footer who could add some rim protection to the team. Hasn't played a ton yet in his career, but he averages 2.5 blocks per 36.  Would much rather have him as a reserve big than Justin Hamilton.  "
"The only game charger we could possibly get would be Marc Gasol. Him and Ricky are very good friends because of them playing together on the national team. Gasol hates big markets anyways because of the attention. If we could somehow dump Peks contract it would be possible but right now we do not have the cap space and ole man Taylor isn't about to go into the luxury tax."
"Keep dreamin.  Those guys are not realistic at all.  They all were on playoff teams and would be pretty risky for veterans to bet on MN.  "
"espn3, ballstream"
"Its really not.  Harden has improved his defense over this past season.  "
"Haha hence the ""wishlist"" part. Also I said at the end I don't think we really have a chance at any of them. "
"And even though Wigs is every bit the prospect that KD was (wiggins is the only player to receive a 1.00 rating by 247), i'm not saying that they comparable.  I was highlighting the fact that OKC immediately gave their prospects the roles that they needed to fulfill to win a championship.


I understand your point for depth, if we could get a veteran to fill his role and then another draft pick to grab a back up PG then we would be improving our depth right??  


Martin took 625 shots in 39 games this year and 1023 in 68 games two years ago, which is 16 and 15 shots per game.  Keep in mind we were dead last in defense last year.  While we don't have rim protection, K-Mart is definitely a negative on defense.   "
"As a big KU fan I'd be happy with Withey. I think with some work he could be a pretty serviceable big in the NBA. Not a dominate force on offense, but a good defender. "
"Rock Chalk! "
"Wiggins' unanimity is not surprising, but I think they got LaVine in the right spot.

In the last stretch of the season, he improved a lot and showed his potential. He has a lot to work on still (defense, decision-making), and wasn't as consistent as the 6 guys above him, but he definitely deserved recognition for a solid first year.

Here's to hoping Zach and Wiggy continue to improve, and we have another unanimous selection next year :)"
"He's a *great defender"
"Probably not. It'll be televised immediately before the game starts, if you're into that kind of thing."
"Fuuuuuu I don't have cable."
"Watch twitter. A lot of times it gets on twitter before the TV broadcast just because of time delays."
"I'll keep that in mind, thanks."
"Realistically the Wolves will just roll with the bigs they have in the event they end up with Russell. In my opinion if they get Russell there isn't really a reason to keep LaVine around and should package him with the couple of second rounders to move up into the top half of the draft and get someone like Turner, WCS, or Kaminsky. "
"[To the people who thought Zach was gonna flop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_srnNASnMyc)

Ya'll a part of the reason he ain't gonna stop

Against the odds, went hard until he popped

Started with a ""fuck me"" now he's handling the rock

had dreams and now they all coming true

Put the team in them things, we got a few

Wanted to make that first team but second'll do

If you a hater just know Zach's shitting on you"
"Preach!"
"Brooke Lopez is a **ssy."
"Pek is already on our team, he plays with heart and hustle, and as fans we support our guys as long as they are going to war for the squad every night.

Doesn't mean we want to use a top four pick to get a guy with a similar set of skills."
"My comment isnt about heart, hustle, or liking a player.

Its about two players with similar defensive abilities. One player you say is good/okay on defense. One player you say is terrible. It doesn't work like that.

If you want to say Okafor is bad defensively, you have to acknowledge that Pek is bad defensively. If you want to say Pek is serviceable on D, you have to acknowledge that Okafor will be serviceable on D. "
"You can get a free week subscription to Sling TV, stream it or go to a bar."
"Asik?  Huh?  Towns already has a floor stretching jump shot.  I don't get that comp, even as a worst case scenario. "
"No one is saying Pek is good defensively. He's a good post defender and bad to very bad at everything else. He has no lateral quickness - he gets burnt in PnR all the time.

That doesn't make him a bad *player*. When healthy he was giving us 16 pts and 9 rebounds on great efficiency (he posted three consecutive seasons of 20+ PER). Okafor will likely be a similar player, a rich man's Pek if he improves his foul shooting.

What I'm saying is I think Okafor will have a great career, probably make multiple all stars games, but I'd rather have Towns or probably Russell. No one is saying Okafor sucks.

"
"I was just trying to think of a dude who's a rim protector but doesn't have a whole lot of offensive game and since I was at work had to just go with what came up first.  You're right, it's not a great comparison, but that why I added the ""slightly better"" bit."
"First time T-Wolves have an all rookie first and second team member since Randy Foye and Craig Smith #Prestige "
"&gt; You don't really want to wrassle with Ticket. He got the best vocab, for sure.

- Kendrick Perkins"
"I wouldn't trade Zach for less than a top 10 pick."
"I miss the Wolves in the playoffs so bad, man. :("
"He isn't worth a top 10 pick, probably not even a lottery pick."
"&gt;Flip: Great memory—remembers everything. There have been times where he's remembered scouting reports from six years ago.

What the fuck....
"
"Umm he was like the 7th best rookie in the draft"
"I guarantee teams would give up a top 10 pick for zach. No need to project your preferences on other gm's."
"Half the rookies were injured this season. "
"If a team is willing to give up a top ten pick for LaVine Flip should jump on that opportunity. Zach was one of the worst players if not the worst player in the league."
"Greg Monroe?"
"God damn it, something about KG just makes me cry. I don't even think I'm that big a fan of his, but his passion is undeniable and I have so much respect for the man."
"So 5-10 combined have a 25 percent chance to get number 1. Why does that make me nervous?"
"[deleted]"
"I don't get why this is getting downvoted, to devote an entire thread for a question you can easily figure out is dumb, should I start making threads asking how old a certain player is?"
"I'm in your corner more than most in terms of criticizing this organization but I do think Zach showed enough real post-ASB improvement to warrant holding on to rather than dumping for future ambiguous chances at good players. He's being put in positions to fail by Flip and I see no reason that would change with a different player we give up on him for."
"Because we likely sit at #4 than #1. It's not going to be a pretty few days as a Wolves fan. The crowd that chants rig is going to be so annoying to deal with."
"Okafor is never going to be that guy on defense. The best you could hope for is he is rock solid on the block, he'll likely struggle with stretch 4s or any 4 with handles that can hit a 15 footer.

That is really his biggest weakness, he doesn't offer a versatile defensive skill set so many teams might look down at that.

Okafor was built for the NBA of 20 years ago."
"I was going to say the same thing. This is such an easy thing to figure out if you know how to use the internet. "
"Hate to say it but likely Kristaps. If not KAT, I'm hoping for Russel."
"I would trade either and probably both if it meant getting WCS to pair with Russell"
"That is incredibly subjective "
"Harden was actually a solid defender last year...he said his time with the national team really helped him. "
"Where is it likely Kristaps? I don't think we would take him until the 4th pick. "
"Yeah probably because we either win the lottery or move down to 4."
"Zach was really, really, really raw... but by the end of the year he was showing flashes of what Flip saw before most of the rest of us did.  The kid is going to be a serious baller if he keeps it up."
"I begrudgingly have to add Zach to my list of ""I thought Flip didn't know what he was doing but turns out I'm just an armchair GM"". 

He joins Shabazz on that list.

More than happy to eat crow if it means success for the team."
"To be fair to you, before Flip came in and started calling the shots, Wolves fans were pretty much always right when believing on draft day that the Wolves management fucked up a pick."
"KAAAAHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"&gt; Trade assets to go up and get WCS, Gorgui, Shabazz, K-mart, Bjelica, 2 high 2nd rounders

If we're drafting Russell, then we could safely add Rubio to this list. "
"And i think that if they give him the time he can bulk up. His offseason training will be only about bulking up. 4 months of straight leg day and lifting, he will become much more solid defensively if he puts his mind to it"
"The Wolves were abysmal shooters last year, and Martin puts the rock in the hole.  Of the few players over 25 on this team, he's the one I'd least like to see shipped out for scraps."
"Well all streaks have to end somehow isn't it. "
"I am so fucking nervous. The fate of our franchise lies in the bounce of some ping pong balls. Since I am convinced we will get the 4th pick, I would be absolutely thrilled with even the 2nd. But you know, the 1st is nice."
"Vote manipulation is against the TOS, so you might want to reword this

"I'm sure there will be a thread on [r/NBA](http://www.reddit.com/r/nba) and I'm guessing somebody will post a steam in there or you can ask for one if nobody does. Just remember to CTRL-F and search for it before asking. "
"It's like Christmas morning as an adult. I've been anticipating it for weeks and I'm excited yet when it happens I'm pretty sure it's going to be underwhelming. 


Here's to hoping I'm wrong and it is still exciting!"
"1, 2 or 3 and I'll be at least happy. 1 and I'll be super excited. 4 and I'll be pretty sad about it as I am a pretty firm believer this is a 3 player draft class. Not saying there aren't other good players but I believe the top 3 will all be All-Stars where the rest are more of a gamble. "
"I have a gut feeling that if KAT is off the board Flip is going to trade down and take either Okafor or Kirstaps, depending on who's still on the board."
"Please be a top 3 pick!"
"We have a 25% chance of getting the #1 pick and we have a 65% chance of getting a top 3 pick. That's what I keep telling myself to keep from freaking out today. 

As much as I feel the lottery is rigged numbers don't like. It's time for our luck to change!"
"This is the highlight of the 'season' for me.  Right now there is hope.  Which will be all but dashed by 7:40 -- when the first three picks have went to LA, NY, and PHI.  Yup, I'm a conspiracy theorist (or realist).  Money trumps all -- and I can't believe a multi-billion dollar industry like professional basketball would let fickle ping pong balls decide where the best talent is going to end up. On that note: my prediction is this: NY and LA take spots 1 and 2.  The league won't reward PHI with one of those top two spots for their obvious tanking -- but being that they are still a big market, they'll land at 3 or 4, with the Wolves taking the remaining spot."
"That 35% chance of getting 4th is all I can think about. PLEASE BE TOP 3!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Its like Christmas morning, where your parents are either about to give you the gift you have been waiting all year for, or going to take a fat shit and put it under the tree for you."
"Vote manipulation? Sounds like this guy isn't familiar with the NBA Draft..."
"I mean it was based on some votes and stuff. I didn't just make it up."
"My bad, reddit won't let me change the title, won't do this again. "
"I'm with you. I believe LAL will get the top pick. The league won't reward tanking and PHI will go 4th. I'm hoping we get 2nd but I'm betting 3rd. "
"It's like June 17th when you tell your parents what you want and they either promise to give it to you or laugh in your face and tell you to fuck off. 

Either way, know for sure for another month and won't get to see any real basketball for six months. Best to just try to think about it as little as possible"
"Curry slipped to #7 for good reasons, which also apply to Russell.  He's a shot-chucker point guard, his college game was predicated mostly on outside shooting, and he isn't strong enough to guard any NBA players in the post.  These are all massive red flags in a prospect.

Curry just happens to be the best shot-chucker **in the history of the game**.  He also plays smart defense, but more importantly GS has surrounded him with 4 very-good-to-elite defensive players."
"How about Roy Hibbert?  All indications out of Indiana are that he is not wanted there anymore.  Obviously he's a train wreck offensively, but our defense is so bad I think he'd be helpful for us overall."

"Sorry for the late reply, was waiting for someone else to make it. http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/05/19/has-the-nba-stopped-fixing-the-lottery-100-not/"
"What streak will end? We have the last 2 #1 picks on our team. Or that we never get the #1 pick?"
"It's a self post so i believe you don't get any karma anyways. ALL WE GET IS REAL LIFE KARMA SO WE CAN SNAG THIS #1 PICK. HOWLLLLLLL!"
"Dammit I wanted to get to this. If anyone wants to pick me shit up I will find you and pay you backkkkkkk..."
"Tonight we learn if we get Okafor, Towns, or Porzingis (Lottery gods, we want this one)

I said that because They^cant read^exponents

And they love^tohate us

See my logic?

"Glad he was able to come back to Minny. Hoping PP34 follows suit to Boston."
"I'm really hoping for a top 3 pick. I think KAT, Russell, and Okafor can all be stars, I would be happy to get any of them. I'm higher on Kristaps than most people here, but I'd be bummed if we missed on all of the guys I listed."
"I am genuinely nervous for tonight. I'd probably cry if we get number one tho."
"Same.  I'll be sobbing in my pillow. "
"It took giving up Love, you know that. Plus AB should not have been the #1 pick, even not using 20/20 hindsight."

"Nah. There'd be some diva crap and Kobe would demand one of them be traded."
"It was a gold mine!"
"Remember, it's not rigged ;)"
"So it starts at 8:30 EST? Does anyone reckon there will be a stream or better yet mobile stream over on /r/NBA? Probably, right?"
"Hopefully not! Really hoping the order doesn't go NY, LA, PHI, MIN even though that would be best for the league. "
"I'm in the same boat. I'd be down there all day but I live in Duluth."
"Actually I think the other guy is right, since this is a self post you should be fine"
"You're right, forgot about that"
"I know we won't get first (because both odds and the NBA hates us), but second would be great, too! Third? It all starts to get dicey. If Okafor goes #2, it can get scary. Does Flip take Porzingis over Russell? What if KAT, Okafor and Russell are off the board and we're #4? Porzingis for sure?!? I like Stein first, to be honest, after the big three. But there's a drop off."
"It's a self-post. No one cares."
"This bit never gets old, seriously, I fall for it every year. "
"Dang. That's not a good sign :/"
"How one can make it onto the Timberwolves' subreddit and now know how to figure this out on their own is unreal..."

I refer to this as ""real people time."""
"I'm not terrified of Turner or WCS.

It was lucky that the Cavs got #1 last year, 76ers and Bucks wouldn't have traded it.

"What a strange couple of sentences:

&gt; If a team is willing to give up a top ten pick for LaVine Flip should jump on that opportunity.

Agreed. Depending on who's available, that could be a steal. Stein? I'd do that. Especially if we get Russell.

&gt; Zach was one of the worst players if not the worst player in the league.

Wait, wha?!? That's a bit of a stretch. Dude just got named second team all-rookie. Remember that he played out of position most of the time... he's not a point guard. It's nice that he's a solid ball handler, but he's no point guard."

"It took me five tries to get the Timberwolves on the ESPN lottery thing, the fix is in."
"Oh well. Not sure what people don't understand about wishlist. He asked who we **want**, not who we might actually get. "
"Second team all rookie doesn't mean shit. Bad players make that list all the time. Rookies this year were terrible too. "
"We have never gotten the #1 pick in the draft nor have we ever moved forward in the draft. Every time the Wolves have had the worst record, someone else got the ping pong balls to drop for them."

"Do it for KG's birthday!"
"I wish I knew about this earlier because I absolutely would have been getting in on this."
"A masterpiece."
"I was really agreeing with him...then go to the end. I know you can't argue with the numbers and all the proof that it's not rigged, but as a T-Wolves fan it's really hard not to feel like it is when you look at our lottery history. We have never moved up once. "
"I live in Florida and am really sad."
"If we get the third pick and take Porzingis over Russell, I will... I'm not sure, but it won't be pretty. "
"The shoes I ended up buying for $20 were worn by Zach LaVine in an [October exhibition game against the Bucks](http://cache2.asset-cache.net/gc/457396768-zach-lavine-and-thaddeus-young-of-the-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=GkZZ8bf5zL1ZiijUmxa7QY%2FH0PUDkQZKHo5mt3Ye5arnl91EhVdkMXoFR6sjT4DP5KZ2c1EIjGX%2BtviTXpHTXZIaB7A0J0inKP3kXpDmGj3x7t%2FsuKEQyyQFpbQd7VJl). If this means my dunk game is going to be fierce tonight at Lifetime, then it was well worth the $20!"
"Nice score! (So jealous)"
"Bulls fan, but I still want you fuckers to win."
"Yes. 

Edit:

I'll expand on this a bit. Russell is similar to a Brandon Roy or a James Harden in that he's going to be his team's primary ball handler on offense regardless of his listed position. Even if they call him the SG, he'll effectively be playing PG. This means that he'd be a fairly poor fit next to Rubio, a guy who is his best when he can work with the ball, but a fine fit next to LaVine. So, even if they want to continue to call LaVine the PG and Russell the SG, it would be functionally identical to calling Russell the PG and LaVine the SG. Regardless, Russell has the ball handling, passing, and pull-up jumper to be a fine PG. "
"Yeah, he seems to be more of a Dante Jr."
"Very good. Even though you can create a reasoning for every scenario doesn't effectively validate that those scenarios are actually beneficial to the league. 

All I'm saying is that until documentation of numbers allocated to each team are released to the public before hand, and the draft is performed infront of an audience I won't believe shit. There's absolutely no reason to hide any part of the draft if they weren't doing something wrong to begin with.

 It costs more money creating this behind the scene production."
"I know that. But I was just making sure what streak he meant lol"
"The Wolves missed an amazing opportunity by not sending him to represent the team at the drawing.  Maybe he chose not to go so he could celebrate at home though, I guess."
"I'm pulling for you guys. Wiggins needs a side-kick.

EDIT: Who do you want in the draft? "
"Yes I know my timberwolves! "
"1. KAT
2. Okafor
3. Russel
4. A swift and painless death"
"Ah. Now that makes plenty of sense. It's not that Rubio would be supplanted as the PG, it's that he'd be improperly used and it would be smarter to move him."
"Yes, based on votes, which are subjective opinions of the voters, some which had him on the first team, some of which didn't have him on a rookie team. "
"So dumb, but I lol'd"
"Hopefully after he signs his rookie deal he'll be able to afford long-enough pants (and a pair of socks)."
"He's also holding the Knicks and Lakers hats "
"Cassell was already a great match, except for age and health. Even with the snail's pace in 03-04. Or Ray Allen from 1996.

Or early Brandon Roy. Maybe his knees crumble sooner and it negates getting Love (Mayo), but still."
"If we get the first and Flip issues a statement welcoming Kristaps Porzingis to the team"
"Now I don't even wanna watch the lottery..."
"Isn't Lavine already his sidekick?"
"Pekovic/Bennett/#31/#36/Budinger/Future protected first to Philly  
For  
??? Plus cap space to get Marc Gasol with.

It's really not as hard as you think to get raw cap space.  You just gotta pay one of the multiple teams selling it this year."
"I'm curious, why are people higher on KAT than Okafor? I've seen Okafor play quite a few times and he's got a lot of Tim Duncan in him."
"Russell please"
"He needs a good one, lol. 

Lavine could end up being really good, but so far the only thing he's proven he can do is dunk and turn the ball over. The Wolves can't bank on him becoming an all-star. "
"Defense. Nuff said."
"KAT basically is all defense with killer free throw percentage and a lot of offensive upside. He is pretty much the perfect match for our team. Okafor on the other hand is beastly at offense and had a bunch of blocks but his defense is weaker and we realllllly need defense "
"Personally, overall athleticism. 

Sure, Towns has the better shooting touch and more defensive inclination than Okafor -- these are important.  But looking at the elite post players in the league right now... they are all athletic freaks.

I'm not sure Okafor will be able to hold is own. He won't be able to push guys around like in college and be quite as dominant as everyone thinks.

Just my observations -- I hope I'm just overly pessimistic because I don't like our chances to get Towns."
"WE DID IT REDDIT"
"KAT"
"1. Towns/Okafor (I cannot pick) 
2. Towns/Okafor
3. Russel

"Pullin for min to get #1 pick."
"Lol"
"I love lavine! Dude will be a serious baller in a year or two, MAX"
"Another beer"
"What channel will it be on? I plan on gettin some beers and watchin it. Anyone else in hilton head SC that wants to watch this shit go down?"
"Through trades tho. "
"We need a defensive anchor really bad. Pek is a siev, gorgi is alright but he's really raw (could be awesome off the bench in the future tho). "
"Wtf is that"

"F.S. largely bases his statements on advanced stats, which say Zach was incredibly detrimental to his team when he played. Combinations of his turnovers, inability to run an offense when playing PG, propensity to take bad shots early in the shot clock and bad defensive IQ led to him being terrible last year, even if he had some games where he put up a lot of counting stats. 

That said, watching him I did think he improved later in the year and has some potential playing off the ball. If he improves his defense and shoots a bunch of threes, as well as learns how to use his elite athleticism and speed, I think he can be a good 2 guard. I'm hopeful that some combination of playing out of position with horrible coaching held him back. He can be a good player, but he's got a long ways to go and most players who are that bad their rookie year do not grow into nba player. His ceiling is an all star, but he's much more likely to be a bench rider or out the league in a few years. "

But I agree PF is the biggest black hole on the roster.  We at least have a legit starting PG and C, assuming good luck with injuries.

"100% agree.  When he was at Duke he played against a lot of ""bigs"" who were passable at that level, but he was bigger than them and it made his job super easy.  When he went up against true bigs in the collegiate game, he wasn't nearly as effective.  In the NBA every big guy can play on both sides of ball (compared to NCAA, that is)"

The player he's chosen in the draft are also largely unproven and there performance did result in the team having the worst record in the league (remember Derrick Williams, Wes Johnson, and Jonny Flynn all made All-Rookie team rosters).

""Don't want to shoot? That's fine come on into the lane and brick that layup"".

Looking at WS/48, Dieng, Hamilton, Bazz, Garnett, and Onuaku were the only Wolves above league average.

"
"It's at 40 upvotes, therefore 4th pick confirmed."
"I agree we shouldn't take Frank 4th, but I'd rather have him than Porzingis, who a lot of people want to take 4th.

Frank's a better shooter, much better passer, and better rebounder than Porzingis. I don't think you'll find anyone who thinks Porzingis is better than Frank right now.

Porzingis's advantage over Frank is age, athleticism, and the mystery of being a European prospect who hasn't been nitpicked like college guys. 

Its a matter of opinion on how much of Porzingis's potential will be realized. I personally don't think Porzingis will reach Kaminsky's current level. "
"I feel like pick 2 is the best spot so we don't have to decide between KAT and Okafor haha"
"SHHHHHHH"
"Haha, well played"
"He's like Timmy on one side of the ball....

...and actually has a ways to go to be Tim on that side."
"I guess it depends on which stat you wanna look at.  My favorite is RAPM, and according to that statistic, Dieng, Hamilton, and Shabazz are all in the bottom quartile of the league. 

As far as the eye test, Dieng looks the part b/c he's skilled offensively.  With Hamilton, I just don't see anything there but opportunism.  Finding the open spot in a lazy defense, getting putbacks, etc.  He looks like a garbage time player to me. "

"I don't see Pordinkus here, Flip. Take note. "
"I'm scared."
"And size. Frank may be a 7 footer but his wingspan is only 6'11"". 

You are underrating age as an asset as well. 3 years down the road once Porzingis hits Frank's age (22) he will be better than Frank at the same age.

If you compare Kristaps right now and Frank's Sophmore year you will see that Kristaps is the much better player. Frank developed in his 4 years of college.

Frank shot .547/.311/76.7 his sophmore year. This year in the Eurocup Kristaps shot .556/.459/70.7. 

Frank avgd 16.2/3.2/6.8 Pts/ast/rbd per 40, KP avgd 22.2/1.4/7.9 with the same metric. On a purely per game Frank had 4.2/.8/1.8 on 10 minutes, Kristaps had 11.6/.8/4.1 on 21 minutes.

So while yes Frank right now is better at shooting and rebounding, he wasn't better at shooting or rebounding when he was Kristaps age. Frank developed heavily in his 4 years at Wisco. Wisco's system also gave him the opportunity to rack up the assists.

I am not even a Kristaps fan but calling him worse than Frank is fucking bananas. Kristaps has better size, and athleticism, while showing that he has a good and developing shooting touch. If he can grow onto that frame even more and get a back to the basket game he could be very good. Or he could end up like Bargs.

We also have no idea how well Frank will be able to play at the NBA level. Even in college he had trouble finishing over length(probably due to his awful wingspan, and average explosiveness/athleticism) so imagine how he will do against the monster waiting for him in the NBA. "
"Okafor also rarely scores outside of the pain. Kat has a solid jumper.

Opening up the pain will help Lavine/Wiggins/Bazz drive since the person on Kat will have to suck out a bit. "

I did not think of WCS or Mario. 
My idea was we would need some kind of big guy/ "

There is only a 0.2 percent change that we DO NOT draft Jahlil Okafor. "
"Well Mario is a SG/SF but you mindfarted WCS hard. "
"If we don't get the #1 or #2 pick.... Do we attempt to trade up?..."
"Would the Wolves pick either Russell or Mudiay at 3? I feel like with Wiggins, LaVine, and Rubio the backcourt might get overcrowded but they also seem significantly better than anyone projected after them.

EDIT: assuming towns and okafor are taken"
"*""So, we've already established that David Kahn is basically President Hoover, right?  Well, once we added Wesley Jonhson (AKA The Smoot–Hawley Tariff), that's when things really started getting ugly...""*"
"Russell at 3 looks like the consensus pick for the wolves in the event the 2 bigs of Towns and Okafor aren't available. Rubio-Russell-Wiggins would be a very fun offensive lineup. Also there is also the chance that Okafor may be available at 3 as well. "

"&gt;You are underrating age as an asset as well. 3 years down the road once Porzingis hits Frank's age (22) he will be better than Frank at the same age.

I'm not underrating anything. I made this exact point, and said its a matter of opinion of how good Porzingis will become. I don't think he'll be as good as Frank, you do. Like I said, opinion.

&gt;So while yes Frank right now is better at shooting and rebounding

&gt;I am not even a Kristaps fan but calling him worse than Frank is fucking bananas. 

You literally agree that Frank is better right now, then say it's bananas to say he's better.

Great post arguing against points I didn't make, while agreeing with the two points I was making, which are simply: Frank is better right now, and Porzingis may eventually pass Frank."

"Yeah our front court is crazy promising. Nerlens killed it this year and he's an absolute defensive force who's only getting better, and Joel is a super super high ceiling prospect who will definitely have a huge instant impact on the team next year. If we had gotten the first pick I imagine we would've traded down or drafted Towns and traded him since our front court is set for the future.

I'm a Seattle sports fan in general...so at least we've won something in the past five years. I feel really grateful. "
"no"
"I would take that trade. "
"right? he wasn't looking too hawt."
"I'm a finance major and yes it makes perfect sense. There is a thing called Oppertunity cost. When it all comes down to it, the league is all about making money. The Timberwolves arent going to make money unless they have a good team. Itmakes perfect sense, they figured if you pair up a great center with a great player (wiggins) the team has potential to make some big bucks for the NBA. 

I'm not too salty. I'm a sixer fan and I want Russell anyway. But the Lottery is rigged. The fact that the Cavs got 3 out of 4 #1 picks all to get Lebron back in Cleveland to change a low market team into a big market team. They realize the Heat, Lakers, Celtics, Knicks will all make money regardless. 

Congrats guys"

"KG MENTORING TOWNS WOO"
"In a mili-second, this guy thinks Dieng is a rim protector and would give up a pick?  If only Ainge were that naive about Dieng.  "
"I'd take this in a HEARTBEAT. Not to be a downer in our happiest moment in years, but Dieng's defense is very bad, and I think we should trade him before people realize that, especially with a center almost certainly coming in the draft. Sullinger is solid and picks are always great, I'd take it without the pick honestly. "
"I know right, I didn't have the heart to tell him he was getting swindled. "
"Can we finally draft Shaq so Crunch can come down from that Billboard?"
"Really?"
"Dieng is not a rim protector? I admit I haven't watched much of the Timberwolves games this season, but Dieng has been putting pretty good stats. 1.7blks/game last season."
"Ok, I admit I havent watched many (or actually any) Timberwolves games this season. I only know that Dieng was on my fantasy team, and was putting great defensive stats, lol. Is he really not a good defender?"
"Dieng allows opponents to shoot 55% at the rim. Wolves were the worst at defending the paint last season. "
"Ok, how about Sullinger for Dieng straight up. No draft picks involved. Or maybe a 2nd round pick?"
"Nope I already agreed to the initial deal, no take backs. "
"[HOP ON BOYS!](http://i.imgur.com/DvA8BIH.gif)"
"Check his player tracking numbers.  Last I remember he was giving up the low 60% at the rim which is crazy considering what you said, he blocks some shots and still let's in shots at a poor rate.  He's just as bad as Pekovic. 

Edit: was wrong on the percentage, but he's still a poor rim protector. "
"Yeah except the amount of money that the Lakers or Knicks will make for the league will increase more than the increased amount of money the Timberwolves will make for the league if they are competitive because of sheer market size. 

Sure, the Timberwolves may lose money now because they are bad and the Lakers and Knicks may make money but overall more of a positive financial impact would likely come from the Lakers and Knicks being highly competitive teams"

Lavine and Wiggins have potential on that end, but they don't understand how to play team defense yet. Hard to force people to shoot a low percentage around the rim when guys are constantly able to penetrate the defense."

Our team defense as a whole is terrible. People here blame it on Pek and Dieng, and they are going to be very disappointed when Towns comes in and our defense still sucks unless changes/improvements are made. 

Edit: also, this will get downvoted by the same people who think Towns is going to make us good defensively. There's literally a post in our sub about going from worst to first in defense by adding one rookie. Just dumb."

Okafor played 28-30+ a night....



So inflate those minutes and Town is better statistically in almost every category."
"I like Okafor but with the first pick you'd be stupid not to take Towns. He might not have Okafor's low post polish, but it's almost as if we have a Towns shaped hole in the roster and he happened to come along just at the right time.

He isn't just the player we need, it's almost like he was designed to fit this team perfectly. During the regular season and the time in between the lottery, I posted about how lucky we'd be to get Towns because it'd save us so much trouble and grief adjusting the roster, he'd just be the perfect drop-in solution to what we have here.

Okafor would make us have to get extremely lucky to get a stretch 4 that can defend and protect the rim like Ibaka, which would be extremely difficult to find.

Porzingis could easily be a bust and Russell would've meant the end of Ricky or LaVine as serious long term pieces.

But somehow, we managed to get the chance to draft the perfect piece in Towns and I sincerely hope we don't fuck ourselves over on this one."
"Love it!  He looks genuinely happy!!"
"I believe the fans are wrong before i believe Flip messed up."
"Offensively - higher floor/ceiling  
Defensively - lower floor/ceiling

Generally people here like Towns over Okafor because Towns' defensive ceiling is more important to our team as a whole than Okafor's higher offensive ceiling.

Okafor is likely to start much hotter, while Towns will take a little while to be a great offensive presence, but Towns can man up on guys, Okafor isn't the same type of athlete."
"Excuse my ignorance, but how did he get more minutes if Towns was such a stud? I know Kentucky had a deep bench, but still...

Also, that doesn't effect %'s... What are advanced stats?"
"I still don't have a tag for you. I should really figure one out. "
"Good call... Except for shooting percentage, I guess... 

And, I am defaulting to you here.... So, I've heard that Okafor is more polished Offensively, so is Towns actually better than him as your statement implies, offensively? And it's just a minutes thing?

I hadn't heard that before. Obviously."
"I am actually totally on the fence. I kinda figured that Gorgi could D up and Okafor could score, while Pek inevitably recovers from season injury number 15 that occurred when a soft breeze hit his ankle. 

But, I am learning more about Towns from you guys and definitely can see how that makes sense... I have read that Okafor is going to be the better rookie but Towns will end up being the better player. Also... 

Either way. This is fucking exciting as hell. I'll have to get my season tickets back. Even though I left an angy drunken message on the sales persons phone after we traded OJ Mayo for Love... Apparently I like the wrong guys!

Egg, meet face.  "
"I think Towns has a higher offensive ceiling. He probably will never have Okafor's low-post game, but he'll make up for it with his ability to hit midrange shots and 3 pt shots, as well as being an 80+% FT shooter. "

"eh, another struggled year.  Hopefully one where we start gaining momentum for 2016-2017.  The third year is when superstars will their teams to the playoffs for the first time.  I bet we improve but end up with the 7-10 draft pick..."
"No way. It's not like we just hoisted the Larry O'Brien trophy. He dug a serious hole. Now we've had some good fortune to put together a team that brings the Wolves back to contention. Kahn still wasted several years of this team with his ineptitude"
"Kentucky had 3-4 7 footers that they rotated between and the system didn't really fit Towns' skill set. Advanced stats put everyone on an even playing field, regardless of minutes played. They also take into account aspects like usage and efficiency.

Efficiency rating:
Towns 31.4
Okafor 30.7

Rebound Percentage:
Towns 18.5%
Okafor 16.6%

Block Percentage
Towns 11.5%
Okafor 4.5%

Plus/Minus per 100 minutes
Towns 17.3
Okafor 10.9

Free Throw %
Towns 81.3%
Okafor 51%

Those are the stats that stand out to me. Okafor shoots at a higher true shooting rate, but he should since everything is within 8 feet of the hoop. The basic stats don't tell the whole story since Okafor got way more minutes and the offense ran through him, whereas Towns wasn't asked to do a lot besides defend. Also, the free throw disparity is huge. Towns shoots at an unreal rate for a big man. He can spread the floor and even knock down 3s, while Okafor is confined to the paint. We already have a low post scorer in Pek, I don't know why we would ever go Okafor over Towns, who is a much better fit all around. He plays better defense, is more athletic, a better rebounder and his offensive ceiling is higher."
"Kahn vs flip. How have flips picks gone so far? Lavine was supposed to horrid. Shabazz, same. Flip has a better eye than Kahn, so he will make the correct choice."
"I think its a joke..."
"On the other hand, we could also have Steph Curry, DeMar DeRozan, and Paul George right now, so no."
"I'll never forgive him for passing on Curry"
"http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Nemanja-Bjelica-5510/ This help? Kinda old, but gets the point across. "
"Absolutely not. He passed on the league MVP for Flynn. He set our franchise back even further. Fuck David Kahn. "
"This would be the first time in NBA history. We are going to be the first."
"Ha. Seriously? Minnesota is not some fucking barren wasteland covered in snow all year long. With Wiggins alongside and LaVine looking good, our core is better then both LA and New York. And besides, people who come here fucking fall in love with it. KG did. Greg Jennings was fucking cut from the Vikings and likes it here so much, he is raising his family here. "
"Thanks!"
"No problem dude."
"Right. Why would Towns or Okafor *want to come here?*

1. They would get ton a playing time allowing them to develop. (Sounds terrible)
2. Allowing them to develop could set themselves up to sign a max contract in the future. (They probably hate money)
3. Who wants to play along side the most promising young star in Wiggins? (They probably hate other good basketball players)
4. A market that wont run your out of town and put you under a microscope. Were just happy your here. (They would probably rather go to a place like LA to get ridiculed and savaged on a daily basis) 
5. Its cold. (SHUT THE FUCK UP)"
"You clearly haven't been a Wolves fan for very long. It's only natural to prepare yourself for what we know will inevitably happen."
"Demarcus Cousins too.. David Khan is the worst GM in the history of professional sports "
"What he said."
"I don't think there is any reason we can't get 35 wins.. barring any serious injuries

PG - Rubio/2nd Rounder

SG - Martin/Lavine

SF - Wiggins/Muhammad/Budinger/Hummel

PF - Bjelica [Might play SF]/KG/KAT/Payne/Bennett

C - Pekovic/Dieng

Love leaving is the best thing that could have happened to this franchise"
"Hey thanks! You guys are looking good too with MCW, Giannis, Parker, etc. Not to mention you guys get the 17th pick in this draft. Some other 17th picks you may recognize are Shawn Kemp, Doug Christie, Aaron McKie, Jermaine O'Neal, Josh Smith, and Danny Granger! Good luck next year"
"I think this year will be quite similar to last in that there is the one player who has a more ""defensive mindset"" with more potential of being the superstar if their offense develops, and then there is the player who is arguably ""more ready"" now. The ""more ready"" player may be the clearcut NBA talent when it comes to the offensive side of the ball, thus keeping their name in contention for the number one pick; yet their defense leaves you asking questions. However, I think like last year, while the speculation may continue all the way up to the draft, the player with more potential will get drafted first overall, and we will take Karl Anthony Towns. He is too perfect to lineup alongside Wiggins. We just have to trust that Flip will make the correct decision. "
"My mouth is watering"
"I don't understand why KAT is buried in this roster. Shouldn't he be getting minutes at the 5 too? "

"Yeah, there's basically no merch left besides some Love stuff that hasn't been bought yet."
"[deleted]"
"I completely agree. We are going to have some pretty solid depth at PF/C. The trend has been that someone will get hurt for a significant amount of time so this is a good problem to have. KAT will get solid minutes. We must remember that KG is old, Pek is a liability these days, Dieng still needs to find his defensive presence, and Bennett/Payne are still trying to figure out what kind of players they want to be. There will be a ton of questions answered next year."
"I prefer Towns too. But to say Okafor is Pek 2.0 is nowhere close to reality. "
"Lavine could still be horrid.   He went out of his way to nab Adreian Payne. The track record is good overall, but too small and imperfect for him to be impervious to all criticism.  This is Timberwolves.  We have every right to be worried.  "
"He would. But he would play the majority of his time as a 4 cause he can shoot."
"Flip loves Okafor and might take him.  That's reality.

And the draft is much more than a week away, so you're gonna be hearing about it for longer than that. "
"I just like KAT better. Better defensively, better athlete, can score outside the paint, shoots very well at the line.

Let's also not forget that him and Wiggins are somewhat close due to the hoop summit.

Getting okafor won't crush my soul, but I will be somewhat disappointed."
"yeah the wolves should totally grab towns at #1. they'd be really stupid not to. "
"It's not that I don't mind Okafor, it's just that we already have a low post scorer/poor defender tied down for multiple years in Pek. Going Okafor just seems redundant when Towns helps our needs so much better. Also, Towns has the range and the athleticism to slide to the 4 if we need him to."
"He really has been and I can't stand Zgoda. He put him atop his mock draft and I think that's what Ding ran with. Hopefully there's nothing else."
"If anything he will be doing Duffy a favor by letting his client play in LA or possibly New York."
"Bill Duffy represents a shit load of people. Honestly not that worried in this aspect"
"Yes it does.  Towns is the new school Anthony Davis type player.  Okafor is the old school center. If okafor was 7'2 I would take him.  He just isnt big enough for his game to be dominate in the NBA.  In college he was the biggest strongest guy on the floor.  In the NBA that won't be the case.  Okafor will flop.  Towns is the real deal.

https://youtu.be/QoHfZOdh2pk"
"He is also the conductor for the Porzingis train iirc "
"I get why some might think that but I honestly don't think that at all. Yes Okafor does need to work on his D and I'm sure he will but as for his offense I think he is so much more dominant then Pek. Pek is a solid offensive player but I believe Okafor is special and will be a dominant force on offense. He honestly reminds me a lot of Demarcus Cousins who is finally coming into his own."
"&lt;3"
"Was the ""LOVE"" just for emphasis, or was that a little throwback to K-Love?"
"This is a great question.  Im mguessing we will be trading the 36th pick since some teams in the late first dont like the guaranteed contracts.  Not sure who will be available at 31 but it will be interesting to see. "
"Right, I thought it looked better without it. I'm not trying to claim credit for it, but I apologize. "
"Package both to move up into the late first round and grab Tyus, Wood, Upshaw, or RJ Hunter. "
"36 + Payne for Jones. Draft and stash with 31
"
"KAT fits the modern game.  He could be the dominate defensive piece like deandre jordan but make free throws.  Dominate in pick and roll like anthoney davis.   
edit: too many mistakes too excited for number 1 pick"
"Right on. The Bucks are actually my second favorite team, as they're in the same hopeful-uprising state as the Twolves. I would LOVE nothing more than a Twolves/Bucks rivalry in the near future. "
"KAT is scouted at #1.  The fact that he fills a need is a bonus that we should happy about, not skeptical. 

It's amazing how often people want to make the argument: Flip did the Burke trade.  I trust him.

Lavine could very well still be bad.  Jonny Flynn made an All-Rookie Team.  Flip's track record isn't so good that we can put blind trust into whatever he wants to do.  

Even if Flip was Lord Popovich himself, we should still analyze prospects/decisions.  There is no discussion otherwise.  

""I trust Flip because of ABC good decisions.""

""I don't trust Flip because of XYZ bad decisions and his ugly catcher's mitt face.""

So boring."
"Pek shouldn't change any of our plans."
"Draft Kat number one, and the Harrison twins in the second round.  We will dominate!

Edit-please don't down vote.  I know we are not using one of the second round picks, but a life long Kentucky fan can dream! Right?"

"Towns/Okafor won't be there for you. Russell is yours. "

"I'd prefer KAT because I think it todays league you need a non-traditional big instead of a back-to-the-basket big and obviously we need to sure up our defense.


However, I don't think we can go wrong with Okafor either."
"What do you mean he's not a part of our plans? We are paying him 12 million a year for the next 3 years. You want to just ignore that fact? How are you gonna divide minutes between Pek, Dieng and Okafor? They all need minutes and none of them can play the 4."
"No.  wtf"
"&gt; How are you gonna divide minutes between Pek, Dieng and Okafor?

26-30 for Okafor 18-22 for Dieng and 48 on the bench in a suit for Pek"
"I have the unpopular opinion of wanting Okafor but I feel like the Wolves will take KAT, I just think Okafor is going to be a beast one day."
"Kat and Wiggins will do damage in the NBA."
"I would love to see a Wolves/Bucks finals!  As a transplant from WI (I cheer for the Wolves first, because in western WI we always used to get FSN Wolves games on tv instead of the Bucks), I always like to see the Bucks do well.  But, if it comes down to it.. Go Wolves!"

"There are several teams in the 20s with only one pick that would make good trade partners"
"Nobody's giving up value for Payne, I'm afraid. ""Old for draft class"" and ""too raw to contribute"" is the worst combination of attributes"
"To answer your question briefly.. YES, it does matter.  They're two different people.

To answer more in depth...  you gotta go with KAT.  Okafor is a potential bust in the NBA.  He excelled in college because he was bigger than most of his competition and it was easy for him to finish around the rim.  It's not going to be that easy in the NBA, and he's soft right now.  KAT already has the toughness factor, and as many have mentioned.. he's already a great defender (and he has defensive instincts that can't be taught), great passer, has more range on his shot (seriously this opens up so many options to the team and to him as a player), and his post game/footwork can be taught.  Okafor might be technically better on offense with his footwork, but I think he's soft, and I'd much rather have an NBA ready body than a softie that might disappear on the bench after a few months in the season.  

Let's be real, they both have potential to be all-stars depending upon their development over the next few years.  I just think the safer choice is KAT.  Also, at Kentucky they're very well prepped to play in the NBA as that's how they recruit, that's how they run their offense.. The same can't be said for Duke and Coach K. "
"You dont see any chance of LA going with Russell over Okafor?"
"Exactly this man.  I've been echoing the same opinion the past few days on this sub.  Okafor had it easy in college because, although he was technically good, he was bigger than the competition in 95% of his games.  I can't recall specifically what team it was in the NCAA tournament, but when Duke played them, their big was AS big as Okafor, and Okafor disappeared because he's not used to playing tough against someone his own size.  He never had to play tough growing up either because he's always been bigger.

KAT is a tough dude, has more range on his shot, has defensive instincts that can't be taught, and what he lacks in footwork in comparison to Okafor, can definitely be taught at the next level.  And who better to teach him than a very versatile big such as KG?"
"Nah. In the NBA you draft BPA almost always and an Okafor Randle front court wouldn't be bad at all to build around. Yes you need young dynamic guards but they are WAY easier to find than a big like Okafor. 

Okafor may walk into the NBA and already be a top 5 offensive center. "
"I think it's kind of vice versa for who is more tough right? Towns' biggest knock is his strength and toughness "
"I agree with trading up, and I'll add Delon Wright to your list.

(I think we should definitely be looking for a backup PG with the pick though)"
"I hope we trade both of them to move up into the 20s and grab Tyus. If Tyus is gone then with a roster chuck full of young guys already we should look for good trade options for the future. If no trades are available we should draft some guys who plan on playing in Europe and develop a good bit of assets over there."
"Boom and my post is irrelevant lol.  

Lots of politically correct answers in there, but at least he'd be used to the cold ;)"
"NEXT SEASON CAN START ANYTIME NOW!!!!
SOOOO MUCH HYPE!!!!"
"Delon Wright would be a good pickup. For his ability on both sides of the ball. Wolves do need to figure out backup PG but in my opinion signing a vet like they did with Mo Williams is a better option. Need the calm stability off the bench that a vet can provide over a rook. "
"I think they'll both be all-star caliber players, but I still want Towns more than Okafor. Towns' foul trouble does scare me though.

You say we shouldn't draft for our needs right now, but at what point in the future would we not need a big who is good defensively?

(Also, your Shaq comparison for Okafor is ridiculous.)"
"There was text of it somewhere Ill look but it was how he was excited that the wolves won the lotto.  I'll look for it
edit: he talks about his friendship with wiggins and how good he is.  talks about getting mentored by KG.  I couldnt find the text.  "

":') I can see the pic now of Wiggins, Zach, and KAT smiling"
"Full quote from article:

&gt;“It’s not definite,” Taylor said, after pausing for a few seconds when asked specifically about Saunders returning as head coach. “But in my mind, with the effort that he put in this year to bring this team along, it’s probably 90 percent. If he sees somebody and he changes his mind, he certainly could convince me. I think eventually I want a different coach, and I want him to be the GM. My guess is that he’ll go another year.”

&gt;Landing the top pick in the draft may be a nice enticement for Saunders to want to remain in the coaching position, but Taylor says that this recent, exciting development won’t affect that decision.

&gt;“It won’t change,” Taylor said of Saunders’ thought process. “I think that Flip will change if he sees somebody in the coaching ranks that he really respects, and thinks in the long run that they will be the right guy for this team, then I think he’ll make that decision.”

&gt;“We’re sort of taking it one year at a time,” Taylor said with a laugh. “[We haven’t discussed] seven years from now.”

 "
"Look at the centers on the teams that made the the 2nd and 3rd rounds of the playoffs."
"Think Toronto wants Bennett then lol?"
"You decide ;)"
"Weird thing to say but thank you Kevin Love.  i know there are haters but think about this for a sec.  If he doesnt demand out and just opts out.  We get nothing and my guess is a late lotto pick.  Its weird to say but thank you love"
"[Flip pls](https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t51.2885-15/s306x306/e15/11111238_964964123521816_211867476_n.jpg)"
"The argument between KAT and Okafor reminds me a lot of the argument between Parker and Wiggins last year. One has the ability to be a strong defender with the need to develop offensively, and the other is a pro-ready scoring machine with defensive concerns. 

I think both players will be great, I think both players will improve with NBA coaching. However, I think it is much more likely that KAT develops a more balanced offensive game than it Okafor develops a defensive game. 

I think in general it is much easier to teach a player proper shooting mechanics than it is to teach them to play great defense. 

IMO take the guy who, who like Wiggins, already has the defensive ability, and teach him post moves. "
"Oh man would that be awesome."
"Especially because of the Border Battle. It'd be so rad. "
"Yep. Okafor's polished post game won't be as pretty going against guys like Davis, Howard, Jordan, Ibaka, Chandler, Gobert, Duncan, Gasol... All of those guys are defensive studs and you need a guy like that to anchor your defense. Guys like Martin, Wiggins, Bazz, and Pek can get buckets and Rubio can create for those that can't. We really need some defense on our team."
"Totally disagree.  Toughness and strength are two different things.  Townes doesn't back down from a fight in the paint.  Okafor has always gotten by because he's bigger.  When he plays against people his size he always loses the battle. "
"First time I've ever heard him speak....I like that he's well spoken and not an idiot."
"Looks like he was born to wear that jersey. "

"""It would be a blessing and an honor to even have a chance to play for Minnesota and be able to have the chance to play for a great organization and learn from a great mentor like Kevin Garnett,” the 6-foot-11 Towns out of St. Joe’s-Metuchen and Kentucky told SNY.tv at the lottery.

Asked if he was ready for the cold weather in Minnesota, Towns cracked a broad smile and said, “Of course, I’m from Jersey. We’re used to snow, we’re used to cold weather.”

"I think the most important thing right now to know, specifically with this team, is that they're still going to require some patience.  It's easy to get excited about the roster and they are a fun team, but they aren't going to go from 16 wins to the playoffs in one year.  You will figure out which players you love and which you don't watching their games, but that's the most important thing right now, if you think this team is going to be playing this time of year next season, you're going to be sorely disappointed.  It's a process, and the wolves are on their way with it, but it doesn't happen overnight."

"This is retarded.

You take the best player available, period.  It doesn't even matter if Flip was a former lover of Bill Duffy.


Besides Bill Duffy represents a shit-ton of NBA players.  Why aren't we snatchin' up all them, too?"
"The fact everyone on reddit wants us to pick towns, leads me to believe we should take Jahlil. "
"This is beautiful. "
"Lol I mean look it's a bad coincidence but I dont think Saunders is going to just make a pick he doesn't believe in because his buddy reps the other guy. "
"Okafor might also be the better player and pick. Just like Shabazz &gt; Burke"
"If so than I'm an idiot 😜"
"He did a good job of getting the righg guys the right minutes last season even if it took some injuries to get this going. Trust the flip. "
"Oh right. I'm clearly a bandwagon fan who's jumped on the awesomeness that has been Wolves basketball the last 10 years.

That's brilliant deduction right there.  The guy talking about Flip's first stint as GM when he drafted KG and pulled multiple solid players out of the D-League doesn't know what he's talking about and hasn't been a fan since the start. Now you can whine more and lie about Flip's rather extensive and impressive record of player evaluation.  Because I'm a new fan. Right?"
"The 31st pick is actually extremely valuable for contract reasons (non guaranteed contracts), and only 1 pick away from being a 1st rounder. Stash a guy in Europe and bring him over when its ready. (ala Pekovic). "
"Awesome, future Wolve hopefully"
"Well if you aren't new, then you should've learned to temper your expectations by now. Also, Wiggins has brought a lot of new fans to the franchise, so it wouldn't surprise me.

You complain about everyone being worried that Flip is gonna mess it up, but they're just being realistic. No need to be a dick about it."
"I will be disappointed if we dont take him.  I think we will and i would have an open mind if we didnt but he just seems like a player that could become great in my eyes

"His other clients

You guys are reading too much into this whole agent thing"
"haha. fuck no."
"Only if we sign LeBron as a free agent "
"Lol, he didn't say anything like that."
"Wolves did attempt to get Klay Thompson and Tayshaun Prince in back to back years. Also in an interview with Minn Post Flip did say that he does like using Duffy and that Duffy does help Flip makes sure the team and the player is on the same page.   

I don't know if Duffy's influence matters in the decision between Okafor and Towns because Flip has liked Okafor for a while now. But Duffy's representation has played a part in Flip's decision making before and that will probably continue as long as he is running the team. "
"Nope. Never liked love. "
"No. I really like Love and would be happy if he could be on the Wolves again but not for the #1 overall pick. Maybe for the #3, or#4 this year but not #1. "
"Yeah, but we didn't end up getting either those guys which goes to show how much his influence means."
"Things KAT does better: rebounding, range, athleticism, defense, free throws.

Things Okafor does better: post scoring, interior passing.

Offense is easier to teach than defense, plus with his average athleticism, Okafor is gonna be a liability in the paint against a lot of centers. Plus Towns can play the four, something Okafor could never do. I don't even think it's that close."
"Just interesting because it is essentially the same deal that we sent him away for. I'd argue Wiggins was a better prospect as well."
"Because other teams didn't want to make the deal. "
"I think Flip should leave as coach because being gm/coach is quite stressful. They should try to hire mike malone. I believe he was excellent for sac town "
"May the best team win."
"Wasn't aboard the Wiggins is absolutely the first overall pick train. Thought Parker and Embiid were better prospects. Think at least Towns is the better prospect than Wiggins this year. "
"Wolf..."
"Hey man looking forward to it, but i had a question is rubio going to be your pg of the future he always been injury prone to me."
"I would love Mike Malone as coach, and our local SCOOPZ guy is pretty confident that Malone would accept the job without a second thought if offered.

The Dream scenario of course would be Hoiberg, though."
"Not much.  He didn't seem to care whether Minnesota, Philly, or New York took him.  Just happy to get drafted.  "
"It's too bad you cannot read. Critical life skill."
"You're nuts. When Pek is healthy he's the best big on the team, and WILL STILL be the best big on the team regardless of who we draft.

Sitting him is the exact opposite of a good idea."
"&gt;  When Pek is healthy

You have found why I have him on the bench in a suit.  I am not confident that he will ever be healthy again as a player.  Everything I've heard about his feet/ankles reeks of what happened to Yao at the end of his career.

I'm not saying he'll never play again, but I don't expect to see the Pek that can completely dominate the post anymore."
"I don't think he could have delivered a better answer. "
"You talk like an asshole."
"Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. He can't shoot but he was an amazing defender (long and quick) and passes well while moving well without the ball (reminds me a lot of AK47)."
"&gt; Tyus

"
"Gotta do it for the home town. "
"You have him pencilled in on the bench REGARDLESS.

You don't not assign minutes to healthy players based on the ASSUMPTION they'll be injured. That's ridiculous."
"You know it isn't rigged when other fans besides us are now saying it is rigged.  "
"I'm not sure if it's like a Toronto Maple Leafs thing or not"
"I believe personally Rubio SHOULDN'T be our point guard going forward. Yes he's a great passer and can play some solid defense but his lack of jumper cannot be overlooked. Additionally, he was very bad at finishing around the rim on drivers. Basically, my argument questions why you wouldn't want someone that could do those things better when looking at the team we are trying to build. "
"Pek is, at this moment, CURRENTLY injured.  He just had a surgery that is being described as a ""last ditch effort,"" meaning his problems, which have also previously been described as CHRONIC, are to the point where if he fails a physical the Wolves can literally force him to retire.  I am not ASSUMING he's going to be injured, because he is CURRENTLY injured.  ASSUMING that you're going to get any significant minutes from Pek at high quality at the start of the season at this point in time is just entirely uninformed."
"lol true. Wolve just looks weird to me."
"Why would the 6ers do this?"
"Talk to /u/sibewolf  "
"The last thing I want is a petition for KAT with a ton of signatures and we end up drafting Okafor. What a welcome gift that would be. "
"That trade would be terrible for the 76ers"
"Philly is in a perfect position. They don't need the #1 or #2 pick as Mudiay and Russell will be on the board at #3. No reason they should trade up."
"&gt;The ankle surgery Timberwolves center Nikola Pekovic will have next week is worrisome but not considered to be career-threatening

The recovery time for his surgery is only 3 months, which means he'll be healthy to start the season. So why are you benching arguably the second best player on the team? I mean, the fact that I have to explain this to you is maddening - unless you're purposefully trying to have the team tank again, there is zero reason you should be benching Pek. "
"what did he say?"
"&gt;by the sounds of it, he doesn't want anything to do with Minnesota and wants to play for the lakers.

"
"I really like this trade. Wiggins gets to learn from his idol Vince and we score ridiculous depth at every position. It still kind of sucks that Flip chose to give up our 2017 1st for Payne but theres no looking back now. Getting Rozier would be awesome. I love our team even without this trade. "
"Kat grew up in a gym.  His dad is a high school coach in new york.  Kat practiced with the jv in the fifth grade, and played on the dominican national team at sixteen.  He grew up playing against bigger, more physical guys.  Kat is a gym rat, and will blow up in the NBA."
"Every team has a bruiser or two.  They won't let him get off any of his little baby hooks.  I watched a ton of his games and to me he is just isn't big enough or fast enough for his inside game to work in the NBA.  You have to be over 7 feet.  Okafor is only 6'11."
"He already is"
"[deleted]"
"Hasn't Tim Duncan been a stud for the past 20 years playing a back to the basket unathletic style of play?"
"People were touting Parker as lacking athleticism which simply was not true. Is Okafor really that unathletic. He seems to have just as many dominating dunks as KAT. And KATs blocks may be a result of him playing over aggressive D which gets him into foul trouble frequently... I'd be fine with either, just as i would have been fine with either parker or wiggins. When it's all said and done, a parker okafor combo against a wiggins KAT squad may be a toss up
"
"Yeah.. but Duncan was also first team all defense 8 times.. 14 times total.

One of Okafors knocks have been his defense.. he can improve tho.

I personally hope we get KAT."
"But seriously look at that guys profile and read through some of his threads. He asked the same questions recently and got some really good responses. "

"* Where's Vaughn expected to go? If 2nd round, I wouldn't mind giving him a shot. 

* With the other pick I say we take a big man, Rakeen Christmas, that LSU dude, Dakari Johnson, or one of the 7 footers from Europe.

* Trading up is an option, people like the 31st pick; it's essentially a first round pick with no contractual obligation. We could potentially move up in the 20's if someone slides that we really like. Only problem? Then we have to add another contract, and we may not want that."

"Transcript for those at work:

&gt;First question Karl, how much warm clothes do you own?

""Have a lot being in New Jersey, been through a lot of snow storms""

&gt;What was your reaction seeing the Wolves get the number 1 draft pick?

""Very happy for the organization - can't wait to see where my name pops up on June 25th""

&gt;Andrew Wiggins is the star of the Wolves, you have quite a history with him, he's a pretty good friend of yours:

""Great dude, great guy, amazing talent, one of the future stars of the NBA.""

&gt;You grew up close to NY, what was it like seeing them fall to the 4th pick?

""NY fell to 4, that doesn't mean anything to me, I just want to be part of the NBA.""

&gt;Part of MN history is still there in KG, what would it be like to learn from him?

""It would be awesome to learn from a mentor like him, that veteran leadership, he's a first ballot HOF, to have a person like that on your team to be able to learn like that would be one of the greatest honors.""
"
"I'll do my best:

&gt;How do you expect this pick to change the team?

The Wolves have never had a #1 pick in the draft before, and with the addition of Wiggins last year, the potential of adding another potential superstar to the line up is the best news the organization has had in years.

&gt;Who are we gunning for? 

Barring something extremely bizarre, the Wolves will be selecting 
Karl Anthony Towns or Jahlil Okafor. If you ask around /r/nba and the like KAT should go #1, and is a good fit for the Wolves. Okafor was, at the beginning of the season, considered the easy #1 pick but has since (arguably) dropped in position. The Wolves FO hasn't said with certainty who they will pick.

&gt;Are the playoffs a serious chance next year now?

No. Our team is still very young, we had the worst record in the NBA this past year (hence #1 pick), and the Western Conference is extremely stacked. Two or three years down the line playoffs seem much more likely. You have to remember, the Wolves have had the longest playoff drought of any NBA team currently. Any positive news for the franchise is greeted with enthusiasm.

&gt;Why did we send that goofy old fella (Glenn?) up there instead of KG?

My guess? Glenn Taylor had never gone to represent the team before, and this was probably the most highly anticipated lottery pick for the team, ever, so he probably wanted the TV time.

&gt;Anything you wanna fill me in on feel free!

Despite the abysmal record this past year, the Wolves are extremely fun to watch. The roster has been plagued with injuries for many years, but with so many young new additions starting to come to fruition there's never been a better time to start watching Minnesota basketball. 

"
"&gt;How do you expect this pick to change the team? 

At worst we get a solid role-player center; a good sized body to hold down the middle.

At best we get a potential superstar center to compliment Wiggins

&gt;Who are we gunning for? 

Karl-Anthony Towns is #1 imo, but we can't go wrong with Okafor either.  Both of them are players who will make an immediate impact on the team (Okafor probably moreso right now).

&gt;Are the playoffs a serious chance next year now?

It's doubtful, unless Wiggins plays unbelievably *and* Towns/Okafor turn out to be the best rookie since Lebron.

The only positives are that Dallas, Memphis, Blazers might be poised to have down years (maybe Spurs, but I've been around long enough to never count them out.) which gives us a slight chance at an 8th seed.

&gt;Is it time for Minnesotans to hop on Wolves Train? 

It's as good of time as any

&gt;Why did we send that goofy old fella (Glenn?) up there instead of KG? 

Because he's the owner (and apparently good luck) and it was KG's birthday so he probably had better things to do.

&gt;I felt like players in the draft would be more excited to get drafted here if KG was up there going nuts.

Possibly, although I think people are overblowing the ""no one wants to go to MN"" thing (like usual)."
"KG probably would have except it was his Birthday (and today is the anniversary of Malik Sealy's death.)"
"barely"
"Russell does not have the athleticism to be Westbrook...but harden or curry? Maybe.

Your point still stands, though. "
"It was Zgoda"
"Shabazz Muhammad works his ass off for this team. He's my favorite wolf. Fun to watch. "
"Towns is being drafted by the wolves.  I didnt know he had such a relationship with wiggins.  It would make more sense to draft him and maybe be a way to keep wiggins after this contract is up.
"
"Him and malik were really tight. I didnt realize those two dates for him were a day apart. He still shoulda been the one up there. Maybe he could have honored malik in some way too"

"Yes.  Most NBA players have wingspan that are larger than their height.  Shaqs wingspan is 7'7 and he is 7'1.  In sports an inch makes a big difference.  I said over 7 feet also.  6'11 is too short to only have a post up game in the NBA. Kat is true best player in the draft.  We need Kat baby!"

- Potential Superstar Center"
"&gt;&gt;Longtime Vikings and Wild fan here.

Nice. I'm a Wolves and Twins diehard. We can combine to be the greatest sports fan in the city.

&gt;&gt;How do you expect this pick to change the team?

Top picks in the NBA are much more valuable than they are in hockey or ootball. A high percentage of players who have ever made an all star game in the league were top 5 picks. Probably 80% or more of all stars were picked top 15. With the first overall selection in the NBA you are looking to get a major impact player.

&gt;&gt;Who are we gunning for?

Our franchise player, Andrew Wiggins, is a guard/forward. Our next best guy, Ricky Rubio, is a point guard. Our most promising other young guys, Shabazz Muhammad and Zach LaVine, are wing players. We need quality big men (we have two pretty good but not great offensive guys there who both struggle on defense). Lucky for us, the top two rated players in the draft are centers. Karl-Anthony Towns is a mobile 6'11"" freshman from Kentucky with good ball handling and shooting skills who is a force on defense. Towns played only 20 minutes a game in college and might be a jack of all trades, master of none on offense. Jahlil Okafor is a 6'11"" freshman from Duke with massive hands and long arms (both these things are very helpful in hoops) who is considered one of the most skilled players to enter the draft since 2003. He is truly an elite scorer from the low post and elbows and he blocked a ton of shots im college but may lack the mobility to be an above average defender in the NBA. We'll get one of those two guys.

&gt;&gt; Are the playoffs a serious chance next year now? 

No.

&gt;&gt;Is it time for Minnesotans to hop on Wolves Train? 

Hell yea!

&gt;&gt;Why did we send that goofy old fella (Glenn?) up there instead of KG? I felt like players in the draft would be more excited to get drafted here if KG was up there going nuts.

Lol. KG would've been hype.

&gt;&gt;Anything you wanna fill me in on feel free! Excited to see how this pick helps us out.

Wolves are low key one of the best teams to watch in the league. Wiggins is an artist, Muhammad and Rubio are extremely fun players to watch, and the color commentator for the team (Jim Peterson) is one of the best in the business."
"[deleted]"
"Mudiay is more like Russell westbrook imo."
"Good plan, but if I remember correctly, Pekovic's contract situation in Europe had him slotted at that 31st slot no matter what team was drafting there.

I'm just wondering if there is a consensus draft and stash player like Pek in this years draft, because if there is I'm on board."
"I agree but the west is so tough"
"Dude. Flip. Make this fucking happen."
"Let's hope so."
"Alrighty, you've picked the right team! We're on the rise and think we have the potential to have the most exciting young team if the draft goes will. We are going to be the Seahawks of the NBA.


**STARTERS**
As far as catching up, learn the starting five:

Ricky Rubio

Kevin Martin

Andrew Wiggins

PF - TBD probably Towns or KG

C - Nikola Pekovic

So I think the most exciting aspects of the starting five are Wiggy and Rubio. Wiggins is an excellent defender and has DPOY and Defensive First-Team nominations in his future. Ricky is a good defender and a great flashy passer. He came from the euroleague in Spain and it is evident in his style of play. He's a true pass-first point. Kevin Martin is one of my favorites and he is the ""Kobe"" of the team with respect to shooting. He'll easily put up 25 on a team but is criticized for his inefficiency. He is the kind of guy to go on a hot streak and keep us a float in a game. He's also a 38-42% 3pt shooter. Pek is always injured and can't play D. KG is the greatest player in Wolves history and he won the MVP in 2004. He is far past his prime and isn't seen as an impact player anymore. We brought him in to mentor our young players.


**BENCH**

Our bench is probably the most exciting part of the team. Zach LaVine was our lottery pick last year and is a freakishly athletic point guard that a lot of people believe should be moved to SG because of his sweet touch shooting deep, although he jacked up many unnecessary shots last season. LaVine and Wiggins call themselves the Bounce Brothers because they collectively are amazing dunkers and have great chemistry that constantly add up to alley-oops. Shabazz Muhammad is a SG/SF and can easily average 20+ pts per game and was a huge excitement last season. Unfortunately he was out for the majority of the season due to injury. Gourgi Dieng is our backup Center and has a smooth mid-range bankshot. He isn't very good at defense though. Injuries killed our season from being a 30-35 win season to being 16 wins, which ultimately gave us the number 1 pick. At one point we only had 8 eligible guys on our roster and that included a D-League player that we had to call up.

**FRONT OFFICE**

Our GM is Milt Newton. I haven't heard or seen much of his work. Flip gets most of the credit for front office moves. That brings us to Flip Saunders. He is our coach, and President of Basketball Operations. He is known for being great at developing young players and for being a point guard whisperer. Some notable PG's he has coached include Stephon Marbury, Chauncey Billups, and John Wall. He is the winningest coach in Timberwolves history but is not known for being a great coach. He has repeatedly under succeeded with championship caliber teams. (I'm looking at you 2004 Wolves and 2008 Pistons) He has made some smart front office moves recently such as drafting Gourgi Dieng, Zach LaVine, and trading for Andrew Wiggins. Recently he has been criticized for not conforming to new coaching styles that are taking over the league (Moreyball) and refuses to turn away from 90's style basketball. This offseason he has vowed that the Timberwolves are going to become stonger, improve on defense, and improve 3pt shooting. 

**THE DRAFT**

The general consensus between fans is to take Karl Anthony-Towns (PF) with the first pick because he is the better overall player. I have seen however that many analysts have picked Jahlil Okafor (C) over him because he is the greater offensive talent. I don't watch college ball so I my opinion has solely been based off of what I see other people say.

**I didn't include everything but this is a good start**

**TL;DR**: We are going to be exciting! Don't expect it right away though. Andrew Wiggins is our savior. We still have a long way to go but we aren't going to the black hole of basketball anymore.

"I like the piece mike"
"Yeah hate to break it to them but Randle is not that good..."
"True."
"[deleted]"
"Appreciate it.  I didn't set out to write a hit piece.  The prospect just gave me almost nothing to make me believe in him."
"Noel was comparable defensive rebounder and slightly better at shot blocking, but he got a lot more steals than Towns. Towns probably does not have the defensive upside of Noel, but basically nobody in the league except Gobert does. Still, Towns projects as an above average defender (especially blocking shots) and blows him away at everything on the offensive side. Amazing. I can't wait to have this guy on my team (and have him play right away.) "
"I think he is correct and hope but how credible."
"I agree. I think the best thing we can do with Pek now (besides dumping his contract) is to play him limited minutes off the bench. He would be unstoppable against other teams' backup bigs. Even if he starts, we should be keeping him under 24 MPG or something."
"Flip has always said that if they get the #1 pick, he will draft the most talented player in lottery.  That clearly has to be KAT."
"Eh, I think he'll be pretty good. "
"C'mon the dude is 19 and already unstoppable in the paint. I don't know why people can label bust on this guy while praising KAT. Did everybody just change your mind because the ""experts"" did? There's no reason that this Big Jah can't be a superstar. Not to say that he is better than KAT, but I feel it's unfair to say Jahlil won't produce in the NBA. If you're gonna nit pick one stat from one gamely might as well be his 30 pt game. He also was the #1 option for the national champions. Cannot wait to see either him or KAT wearing blue next year.

Go wolves. "
"I have very limited basketball scouting knowledge (aka none), but Towns reminds me of a smoother version of Joakim Noah. Not quite as talented as Anthony Davis. "
"KAT better than Wiggy confirmed!"
"i trust doogie more who said okafor was flips fave back in december, but that is interesting.  Kyler is followed by woj!"
"Dont sweat it. A ton of toxic bandwagon cunts are popping in to soak in the karma, piss people off."
"Don't forget that while you're improving other teams are declining.  The Mavs and Spurs are both potentially looking at rebuilds which opens up a spot for you and OKC right there.  You have a head start on other teams like Lakers and Suns that are rebuilding now.  

I'm not saying it will be easy but you should have an opening."
"Here goes nothing:

Our big man, who art in Kentucky,

Towns be thy name.

Thy 'pick' be good,

Thy team will dominate,

As long as KAT is chosen.

Give us this pick our daily block

And forgive us our misery for the past decade,

And lead us not into the lottery again

But deliver us a championship.

In the name of flip, do choose KAT

**Amen**"
"Over 350 votes were casted.

Karl-Anthony Towns received 246 votes

Jahlil Okafor received 67 votes

Trade Pick received 21 votes

Other Player received 10 votes

D'Angelo Russell received 7 votes"
"No I watched all if their games.  Followed them in high school.  Kat played on the Dominican republic national team when he was 16."
"Thanks dude!"
"I feel like you could get in touch with Robbie through twitter."
"Until the Wolves prove to be a functional franchise they deserve all the shit people spew, whether it's painful truths or ignorance.    

EDIT: just watched ATH, I'm guessing he must have been worse on HQ, his ATH thoughts were nothing to be upset about.  "
"That world team in 2013 was so salty.  Dennis Schroder(playing ECF), Dante Exum(4th pick), Wiggins(Superstar), Towns(1st pick), Embiid(3rd pick), Herzonja(lotto pick), Karasev(1st rounder), Jaitah (pick this year)."
"Blind trust doesn't apply here, at all--we're talking about picking the #1 or #2 scouted prospect, either of which could thrive or fail as far as we know. A lot goes into a pick, including talent, coachability, your system, and the players desire to make himself better.

Blind trust would be like Flip trading back the #1 pick + Wiggins for a 2nd round pick + a player to be named later and saying, ""Well, this must make some sense once we see his master plan unfold.""

So, let's be real, he knows more than me, you, and everyone else in this subreddit, and when it comes down to choosing between the #1 and #2 players, it's fair to say, ""I trust his choice."""
"Do you think Towns will play at the 5 for most of his career? Or do you think he will play PF alongside PEK?"
"Thats true."
"anthony davis' stats in college were pretty insane. Davis also grew around 8 inches from his senior year to college. So he was more versatile being that he could handle the ball. I could go into a huge rant about how good davis was in college. Instead I will just say that okafor is more of a safe pick being he has already shown more promise. BUt KAT has such a huge ceiling and athleticism. "
"Wow, Deandre's defense + Davis' offense + FT shooting. Sounds like the next Olajuwon just fell into our laps. 

But, he could also struggle on all fronts and end up a career 6th man (and so could Okafur). 

We're in a great position, but neither is a guarantee. "
"I'll tweet at him and see if anything happens... He seems like a pretty chill dude, so I have a feeling he'll help me."
"I don't think Pek will be here much longer tbh. Way to expensive and he takes minutes away from dieng, payne, soon to be towns."
"Exactly, and Okafor grew up slacking off, played against marshmallows, and will fail miserably. "
"No kidding? Sometimes that's ok. I'm tired of people confusing this for their emotional dumping ground. We get the #1 pick and 4 or 5 people make separate threads to whine about it. At least keep it to 1 thread if you need to do that."
"I wanna believe him so I will.

Flip is always preaching about wanting 2 way players..on kfan today he said multiple times okafor has great footwork similar to Duncan coming out of college..and with Towns he said he is the best 2 way player in this year's draft. 

"
"O yeah I am all for trading him tomorrow. However, I don't see getting much in return. So are you thinking Towns is center or PF?"
"No prospect is cant miss.  "
"Okafor was lots of people favorite back in December"
"Right, I think it's important for everyone to keep that in mind. I just looked at the [list of #1s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_overall_NBA_draft_picks), and there's a lot to be excited about (11/15 all-stars from 1998-2012), but also some huge busts. "
"Half Life 3 confirmed?"
"Check it again, it's been fixed."
"Thanks to whoever did that!"
"i look at him as a mix of a few guys, bare with me. I see him at best being able to stretch the floor like Aldridge, not his post game just his midrange. I think he showed spurts of Anthony Davis' shot blocking ability no where near to the same level but his rim protection is above average. So to answer your question, I think that he is more of a PF imo but he could play center if he put on some weight. "
"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wcz_kDCBTBk"
"Interesting. I am seeing rumors that want Okafor. IMO this would be a tragedy. How are you going to draft a 50% FT shooter with the #1 overall pick we have so highly coveted?"
"His Post play is stellar but like you said he is piss poor at the line. He is also not very good on the defensive side. Seeing as so many people expected him to be the number one pick before the season, he is obviously going to be scrutinized more for what he does wrong. Either one will help, but Im all for KAT. "
"Man, I don't know, but I don't know why this board doesn't have more faith in flip.  His first round picks in his two years on the job are shabazz, gorgi and lavine, all of those guys look like they have a good future in this league, let flip take who he wants and we'll be fine."
"Why do they always ask such stupid fucking questions? Towns was great; he said all the right things. Really excited at the prospect of having him in Minnesota."
"Shaq?"
"***IMPLYING***"
"Tweeted him, still no response... :("
"[Here it is now!](http://i.imgur.com/hYo5fA0.png)"
"hmmm not sure if I see it.  the passing and some of the defense but offensively that comparison does not fit too well."
"Kevin Love lol"
"Holy shit it changes with almost every refresh, First Celtics, then hobos, and now Knicks."
"Everyone is shitting on the Wolves front office.  I think flip has done good so far and he scouted/pushed for KG.  I think our dark times are almost over so who cares what the other teams fans think."
"C: Pek/Towns/Dieng  
PF: KG/Bjelica/Dieng  
SF: Wiggins/Shabazz  
SG: Martin/LaVine  
PG: Rubio/trade 31, 36 and next years 2nd for T Jones?   
Payne in D-league.  Bennett to a rebuilding team for a vet combo guard?

It's really hard to know."
"The Timberwolves CFO gave a lecture in one of my classes this semester and he said before the draft lottery that they were certain who they would pick if they had the top pick so I hope it was Towns."
"That's it.  Someone move Kobe Bryant to the Bulls.  And put Kwame Brown BACK on the Lakers."
"Hey thanks for tagging me. About to go to bed but I'll for sure give it a read tomorrow and let you know what I think."

"That exact comment: ""Flip drafted Lavine and traded Burke; we should trust him"", is made on almost every single topic in the subreddit.  And it's always upvoted.  So apparently the board does have faith in him. "
"Need bigger survey....send to flip and anyone else involved in the decision

"Sweet, when I saw your comment I hoped it was in the SB Nation family and I danced a wee May jig when I saw that it was, they host all of my go-to sports sites."

Don't shit on players for their vernacular. "
"I think 3 years isn't unrealistic. A few teams, like the Thunder and the Warriors, only needed about 3 years before they started making the playoffs with their young core. The silver lining of us sucking (and having injuries) is that Lavine and Wiggins got so many minutes. More opportunities to develop, especially under a mentor like KG, could really accelerate their progress. 

Also I have a lot more faith in Flip the GM more than I do Flip the coach. It's promising that our ownership has expressed interest in getting a real coach. I don't think Flip will be the one who gets us to that next level. "
"I actually bet  a larger survey showing fans want KAT would sway him.  They want to sell tickets...hell lots of people say we brought kg back simply to sell tickets.  If fans want KAT, you watch his tape, realize he's the best fit for the team, and take him.  So much speculation we pick okafor because his agent already represents a handful of our players and is chummy with flip blah blah 

Either way I hope having this pick works out well for the team.  I want to watch my wolves in the playoffs again "
"I wonder about Ricky's future with us. If Lavine develops well, I doubt Ricky will want to be relegated to a bench role. Too soon to tell right now, especially since Lavine's playmaking isn't even close to Ricky's. 

Either way, it's nice to have some assets for really good trades down the line. Would be nice to have some coaches who can bolster our defense though. And our offense..."

"Fixed it, again lol"
"Lavine and rubio can coexist quite nicely lavine is more of a 2

"LaVine is a shooting guard, not a point guard. Flip is using a common strategy to play extremely raw players at PG to improve ball skills and decision making skills. "
"True. I kind of like Wiggins at the 2 though. Obviously he's a great SF as well. "
"Yeah, although there is no way I could really promote it. I could tweet it but who knows how many people would even end up seeing it. I posted it on both /r/Timberwolves and /r/nba "
"Why were you watching the two worst shows that the mothership carries and then caring about what they have to say?"
"same since he can post up every 2 in  the league.  "
"So after reading the article, it sounds like Okafor clearly doesn't want to end up in Minnesota. Whereas when Towns was being interviewed after the draft, he sounded optimistic about the possibility of landing in MN, playing alongside his buddy Wiggins, and being mentored by future HOF'er KG. I respect new players who have a positive attitude about joining a new franchise and don't feel entitled to play for a team with a bigger market. I was already in favor of drafting Towns but now I want him 100%. Let me know what you guys think about the article.  "

"Only problem with Wiggins at the 2 is we already have Martin and Lavine there. Wiggins could start at the 3 with Shabazz coming off the bench, or maybe have Rubio/Wiggins/Shabazz as the starting back court and have Lavine coming off the bench for Rubio while Martin is the backup 2.

"I am a devout Wolves fan, and *I* joked about that. It's not everyone, it's two guys, and the one who looks worse of those two will get to live in LA as a young millionaire, the better one gets Minnesota. You don't see that the #2 is more appealing? 

It won't happen anyways, because they both know if they ""tank"" the draft stock they fall below Russell. "
"This argument is made a lot, but it's still way too early. While Dieng, Shabazz and LaVine look like they have some talent and aren't toally out of place, none have proven they're quality long-term players to build a team with. They've so far proven to be nice players with high ceilings while playing on terrible teams.

I like all three – but it's way too early to say Flip made the right picks there."
"Everyone says Okafor's passing is top-notch already, and that's kind of exciting. 

Pek, even though he's pretty nimble offensively around the basket, almost never passes. Doesn't matter who is guarding him or if he's playing well. He gets the ball, he's shooting. Defenses just kind of collapse and wait for him to take a not-great shot, and that hurts the offense.

Put a more aware passer in there, and run more plays through the middle, and that potentially opens things up a ton. It's intriguing.

But then again, so is someone who can block shots. I have no idea who Flip will or should pick, but it'll be interesting either way."
"I don't understand this mentality. Yeah *some* guys may want to play in a big market. However, I think *more* guys would rather play on a good team and play to win. Anybody can see that the Wolves have a much better core of young players than the Lakers. Not saying the Lakers don't have some good young guys, but our core of young players is a lot more promising. 

Other people will say they have a chance to go and learn from Kobe. That's cool, I'm guessing a big like KAT would probably rather learn from KG. "
"Tyus..."
"I still like some of them, but a lot of them are going down hill quickly. When Bomani first came on Around the Horn he had good insight and made some really good points. Lately he's truing into Stephen A. Smith 2.0 and it sucks because SAS is a complete idiot. "
"Actually, offer them AB and Chase.  After all, they have no *leverage.*  LOL"
"Towns:Duncan

Okafor: Marc Gasol"
"Its a good article. Brutal and blunt journalism is good journalism."
"**Okafor:** I've said it many times and I'll keep saying it. He is Al Jefferson 2.0. He will be a good scorer in the NBA but his defense will be average *at best*, and most likely a liability. Good NBA player, but not great.

**Towns:** I don't know if there is a player I can directly compare him to. He's kind of like Joakim Noah, but not quite as much of a defensive presence in the lane yet, but at the same time I think he will be better offensively thatn Noah.  "
"Got around to reading it now. Great write up by [Jmgill12](http://www.reddit.com/user/Jmgill12). Glad I can reference this when I try to explain why I don't like him as a prospect. "
"Tbh I've never been to Minnesota, and I base my opinions on Fargo and Little House on the Prairie. I quite like that image. "
"Optimistically I'd say around 75. 

Realistically though I'd say probably closer to 25-30."
"Early in the season before Rubio went down we weren't that bad.  I'd say mid 30s are a possibility."
"*If* everyone stays healthy and our young guys continue to develop, I honestly think we could close in on 40 wins this year."
"I'd definitely say barring injuries that 35 is realistic. When Rubio is healthy he does wonders for our team."
"[deleted]"
"Cyanide."
"im gonna say a solid 33"
"And make it look like Dwight Howard left them in free agency... Wait... "
"Counter argument: I like Rubio, he is one of my favorite players in the league. Most people in this sub do not believe he is injury prone as much as a victim to a series of unfortunate events. Early in the season before his injury, there were signs of his shot improving. He was hitting more of his shots, which is a good sign. We just signed him to a 4 year deal so I would assume that he is our future PG. His passing and court vision is top 3 in the league imo and he has potential to be an amazing PG, so I am all in for Rubio at the moment, if he continues to go down then I would say otherwise. "
"Playoffs next year. Quote me. "
"**AMEN**"
"In regards to the ""Anything you wanna fill me in on?"" portion...

Andrew Wiggins is without a doubt the most fun player to watch right now. He's special and going to grow to be a superstar. Already he has highlights posted on r/NBA practically every time the Wolves play. Not only that, but our roster was decimated by injuries this year, so he was doing all of that without any help. With everyone else being healthy again (particularly Rubio), it should only help further him more.

Andrew Wiggins + Karl Anthony Towns could very well end up being the next big duo. It's far too early to say for sure, but they do have the potential to be a duo comparable to Kobe/Shaq. Even if we draft Okafor instead of Towns, either guy has the potential to be huge in this league. We already have a surrounding force of solid young guys. Adding this #1 pick to our group is going to finish off our needs for the future. At that point, we just need a couple years to develop these guys before we start challenging in the playoffs.

Shabazz Muhammad is the next most exciting player to watch. He may not be the 2nd best player on our roster, but he's filled with so much energy, drive, and hustle. He's a small forward and our 6th man, coming off the bench and he can take over with his post game and his insane ability to pull down offensive boards. He's not as naturally talented as others, but his hard work makes him a joy to watch.

Zach Lavine is another fun guy to watch, but don't get overhyped by him yet. He put together some amazing games last year, scoring 25+ points. He was a rookie last year and has a lot of learning to do still. He's much more naturally inclined to be a SG than a PG, but Flip is trying to play him as a PG. I think that's going to help him out a lot fundamentally down the road, but it's a train wreck to watch at times. He's looking like he will pan out to be a really good player, but it's still too early to tell for sure.

Assuming he's back for another year, don't expect much from KG. He's running on fumes at this point and will play at most 20 mpg. He'll most likely be injured for 50%+ of the season. He's still really good when he is on the floor, but it's going to be difficult for him to find how he fits with this team by playing so little. His value will come so much more from being around to coach and mentor our young squad.

Non-Wolves fans sleep on Ricky Rubio big time. He's an AMAZING facilitator and arguably one of (if not THE) best passer in the game. This sets up plenty of highlights and really helps command the offense when he's on the floor. He takes some gambles on defense sometimes, but overall his effort on the defensive end makes him a pretty good defender. Everyone sleeps on him because he's had a historically bad shot (which actually started to look better last season) and he's abysmal at finishing at the rim. He's not going to be a superstar, but don't let anyone tell you that he's not an important piece of our team. With a few years under his belt, he's the leader of this Wolves team.

Flip gets a lot of criticism as our coach and president. Honestly, he's not a stellar coach. The style he runs is outdated. He's trying to instill fundamentals in all of our youngsters instead of letting them rely on chucking up 3's. This is good to a point, but it's really hindering us as a team since we NEVER run plays for 3 pointers. He prefers long 2's instead of 3's since there's a better chance they are made. Flip is just a transitional coach as we wait for a really solid coaching candidate to be our coach of the future. We're praying that Fred Hoiberg finally decides to leave the college game and come up from Iowa to coach when he's ready, but there are no indicators he's leaving anytime soon. This creates a lot of hesitation and anxiety as we worry Flip might hand the reigns to a friend (i.e. Sam Mitchell) instead of someone who could really be a much better option for us as coach.

On the other side, Flip seems to do really well in the draft. He turned Trey Burke (guard for the Jazz) into Shabazz Muhammad and Gorgui Dieng which I think everyone agrees is a pretty good haul. Last year he was able to wade through the mess of the Kevin Love situation to be able to escape with the #1 pick in Andrew Wiggins for the price of a superstar who was already on his way out. He has made a few questionable calls on this front (trading a 1st round pick for Thad Young, also trading a pick for Adrien Payne), but overall it seems like he's pretty good in this area (no Slick Rick, but still pretty good).

It's still going to be rough for a couple seasons, but we should start to see a lot of improvement this year, and possibly a winning season the next. I would say in 3 years we can start eyeing the playoffs. If you're looking to jump on the bandwagon, doing so now will get you in a little sooner than most bandwagonners. We're not going to be *good* for a couple years yet, but we should be plenty exciting if you start watching now.

"haha yeah who ever goes to mn is going to be the loser cause its cold, you can't hang with the kardashians haha yeah lakers are going to win the super bowl haha cause its cold in mn get it guys?"

"It's cute how dismissive ignorant fucks like you are when confronted by others. 

Like I said, don't shit on people for their vernacular, especially when you know that a decent portion come from poor educational backgrounds. 

It's funny you think I'm on a high horse when you've just buried yourself so far in shit that it appears as if everyone is above you. 

Peace doooood "
"How cute would you say it is? Scale of 1-10?"
"It wouldn't be that much of a tragedy. I prefer Towns too, but it's not like Okafor would be a disaster. This is not a dropo ff of Kyrie Irving to Derrick Williams proportions. This is a 1 and 1a situation."
"Nikoloz Tskitishvili.  Now there's a name I haven't heard in a long time."
"The Wolves have never had the #1 pick. There is no way in hell they are going to submit themselves to the PR atomic bomb of trading out of it now that they finally snagged one after all these suffering years. 

Even if a trade opportunity surfaced that was a great deal and made perfect logical sense they'd never do it. The karma fallout from such a move would be too strong. 

The commissioner is going to be on that podium saying ""With the first overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft, the Minnesota Timberwolves select..."". You can bet your life on it. They have no choice."
"Can i listen to this somehow?"
"&gt; Immediately after winning the lottery, Saunders said on a conference call with reporters that the Timberwolves want their top overall pick to fit into an up-tempo system (which makes a lot of sense for them with Andrew Wiggins, Zach LaVine and Ricky Rubio among others part of the long-term plan).

&gt; “I think both [Okafor and Towns] are going to be All-Star type players, but I think when we look at anybody that we look at in the draft, it’s about how they will fit in with the players that we have, what their dynamic is and how we want to play,” Saunders said. “We feel that with Wiggins and with LaVine, that we can be an up-tempo team.”

Flip has adamantly emphasized that we will draft best player available to the media, but then is reported to have said something like this on a ""conference call with reporters."" Strange...

Either way, I like the Flip answers described because they are really, really smart in my opinion. "
"Should be the bumper to bumper podcast 5/20 on kfans website. I'm not certain but I think that's how."
"Maybe check out their website I have no idea! "
"&gt; on offense.

There's more to basketball than offense. Duncan without the defense isn't anywhere near as good of a player. "
"Can Towns just do what Cousins does well with fewer turnovers and misses?"
"Yep, thanks"
"Argh, assuming we draft KAT and his offense is like LMA, that means he will fit right into Flip's ""No 3's allowed"" offense.

I'm all for developing the fundamentals and not letting youngsters rely on chucking up wild 3's, but when you see the success of the current conference finals teams and their reliance on the 3pt shot, it's something Flip needs to develop. Drafting KAT will only allow him to use KAT as a crutch to keep staying away from the 3 point game."
"When I opened this up I was thinking a ""faster"" Marc Gasol."
"9/11. 

What would you rate it? "
"So you're saying he's skinny?

Honestly. 7'1 and barely 200 pounds?!? I just can't fathom it. At my build? I'd be like 340."
"Now I want to see his first reaction to Chappelle's MTB sketch. And anything is possible but in all reality it wasn't recorded."
"Yeah the David Kahn era was a dark time."
"Is there some way to back that up and trade to get Jones at 20 or wherever? 

Subsidize Martin?"
"You think LaMarcus Aldridge plus Ibaka/Noah = poor man's Garnett?..."
"Al Jefferson 2.0? That'd be pretty good, actually."
"I liked him in college but I dont think he is that good on defense.  he is also a bit undersized.  I like some of his offensive game but he needs work on his shooting."
"I guess I should have said Al Jefferson 1.1. Meaning no real big improvements. One trick pony. Scoring in the low post and not much else. Again, not a bad NBA player at all, but not great either. "
"How many times has Al Jefferson made the playoffs? The all-star game? "
"Yes. Aldridge is basically Garnett's offense minus Garnett's elite passing, and Noah is basically Garnett's D. 

So that combo is pretty much a worse passing Garnett. "
"I'm stunned at how low most of these estimates are.

If we're 100% healthy, and get some semblance of a defense, I think we're easily a .500 team. "
"Maybe he wants to be Thad young reincarnate. "
"Al Jefferson willed his team to the playoffs last year before getting injured. He's been there twice before that. 

"
"I'm sure you're mostly kidding, but Towns is/was #12. "
"How many will be needed to get into the playoffs?"
"Yeah I just saw this a while ago and remembered it now"
"32"
"Solid point. I obviously prefer Towns as well, but I won't go out to say I'd be outraged if we got Okafor."
"Was comparing KAT to Tyson Chandler in his prime (think 2011 Mavs) only with better range.  Think the two players have similar physique/post game/ pick and roll game.  Not meant to be a negative comparison.  WCS is to slender for the Chandler comparison, IMO.  He's more like a John Henson 2.0"
"KAT reminds me of (Prime) Tyson Chandler with a better jumpshot/range.  Okafor is going to be a better version of Al Jefferson b/c he's a great passer out of the post."
"Are you confusing Chandler with someone else? Towns is significantly bigger and is much better in the post (Chandler doesn't have a post game). Towns is also a much better passer. Also, saying Towns has better range isn't really saying much since Chandler has no range. He barely ever shoots outside of the restricted area. Towns could be a legitimate 3-point threat in the future. 

[Here](http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/83/files/2014/06/tysonchandler.jpg) is Chandler in 2011. [Here](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/450ac42ee552781f9011985b60048585212aabe3/c=0-40-1316-1796&amp;r=537&amp;c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/14//1397517355000-USP-NCAA-Basketball-SEC-Tournament-Kentucky-vs-LS.jpg) is WCS. They're both about 7'1"" and 240 pounds. "
"I actually like the comparison to Noah, but KAT is a much more dangerous threat from mid range."
"Okafor's comparison to Al Jefferson is legit.  Solid post moves on offense, uninterested big body on D.  I see some young Boozer in him, too.

Towns is tougher to pin down because, IMO, he's much more raw and we don't know what he's going to develop into.  Will his range expand beyond the arc?  Will he pack on some weight and body up against strong centers like Howard?  Will he become a niche rebounding/rim-protecting center like Serge?  I think Noah is the upside of his comparison.  I don't ever see him being prolific on offense like LMA.  

Just my own predictions here, but I see Okafor being a 20-22ppg, 8-10rpg type who benefits from some KG influence and becomes passable on defense.  I see KAT being a 12-14ppg, 10-12rpg, 2+bpg player."
"Only problem with LaVine at the two is that we already have Martin and Wiggins there."
"When you look at our roster, it's seems to me that LaVine is our backup point guard."
"I hate both those shows sooo much."
"I don't know how many times I have to say this before you guys realize it, but Bennett is already much better than Payne and he is 2 years younger. "
"Where did you get this information?
"
"Definitely. I think he's going to be a better offensive player than Noah and if he can become the same type of defensive player Noah is he's gonna be a damn good big in the NBA."
"Wow, it took my brain a long time to realize that him being 24 in 2020 is not a typo. 2020 still seems like it's 10 years out, but it's not."
"If he could have thad's handles at his size that would be amazing. "
"Yea, this was really the first time I've watched the Wolves this season and I was shocked at how awful Pekovic is around the rim and yet takes the shot *every single fucking time* that the ball comes to him.

It goes past irrational confidence to just plain selfishness."
"https://mobile.twitter.com/twolves_pr Is where I got the number change from. u/aManWithoutaMask posted the link originally"
"35 wins if we can stay relatively health. If everything clicks and Wiggy and KAT develop a great relationship on the court and Rubio plays 70+ games I think we could win 40 games. "
"He is potentially close to being like Ibaka/Noah on defense, but I am not sure how he's close to being LMA on offense just because he can hit open mid/long range jumpers? People act like he can easily start creating his own shot near the post like Melo/LMA/Nowitzki but I don't think he's shown enough in that direction. Offensively Okafor has a much heigher ceiling, Okafor will probably be a double team threat in 1-2 years.

And admittedly Okafor is a bit of a fatass right now, I expect his defense will imporve a lot without his offense being affected, once he starts paying some more attention on his conditioning. If the Wolves get Okafor to pair with Wiggins, honestly I as a foreigner will consider hoping on this bandwagon cause I expect they will be by far the most entertaining team to watch in a few years."
"You can watch them play against each other [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLOQWTaD7i0)"
"47ish"
"He was battling major injuries this year. He used to be a **really** good scorer down there. If he ever gets healthy again you'll see why the guys continue to feed him the ball on the block. They trust him to score it."
"Well, that would explain it then. I was completely baffled."
"Towns had a better assist rate and lower turnover rate than Okafor. The reason people say that is because Okafor does those cool, effortless one-handed passes out of the post, but he's far from a ""top-notch"" passer. "
"Try again haha. "
"Yea man Flip is tight with T Jones mom actually so I'm not surprised if he knows Tyus too.

Honestly I expect Jones on the team next year and I'm fucking stoked for that. Flip will find some type of way to get him."
"I wouldn't say he was ""really"" good. He was good, but never consistently dominant. And he's never been a good passer. 

His career, he's made a habit out of missing shots in the paint late in close games. He's an above average C when healthy, but if he's one of your building block guys, that's a problem."
"Between 35-40 

The lineup is too good.

"From Flips interview on Paul Allens show on KFAN:

1. Acknowledges that LaVine's natural position is the 2.
2. Mentions that Martin could come off the bench

Edit: On bumper to bumper Flip also said that the problem with our 3pt shooting this year was a lot of shots were contested, and a big guy who demands a double team (alluding to Okafor) give the shooters the room they need by drawing defenders inside.

EDIT 2: What he said about 3 pointers doesn't seem all that true. [Per NBA.com](http://stats.nba.com/team/#!/1610612750/tracking/shots/?Season=2014-15&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals) 941 of our 1211 3 pointers this season were classified as ""open"" or ""wide open."" That's 77.7%.

EDIT 3: [turns out 77.7% is good for 5th worst percentage of uncontested 3s in the league.](http://i.imgur.com/IVjj2ZB.png)"
"Everyone seems really high on Tyus, and I feel he gets more buzz than any of the other projected #7 - 20 picks. I'm sure it's due to him being from MN, but I hear nothing but great things about him.

If Wiggins averages 20 PPG and improves his efficiency.

If LaVine, Gorgui, and Bazz all continue to develop.

"**WE ARE MAKING THE PLAYOFFS THIS YEAR BOYS**

"Bring it! K mart can do the same thing coming off the bench get 20 points usually and not be as much of an injury risk!"
"I think we will be fighting for that 8th seed and probably fail to reach it. I can see us having the same amount of wins as we did in kevin loves last year. But all the games will be competitive and probably just lose by 4 "
"If Flip continues to focus on development rather than winning, probably not as big of an improvement as most people are hoping for"
"Hey! I'm from St. Louis too! Welcome to the sub! You picked a soon to be very good team. "
"Agree to disagree. I saw a shadow of what he was in his SAC days. I think his wife's illness had a lot to do with it. In any case, he was better than anyone we had since Flip and was no worse than current Flip."
"Why are people okay with the fact that Rubio is inevitably going to get injured? Or the fact that Pek will also get hurt. We are wasting millions of dollars on these guys yet people on here call blasphemy when getting rid of them gets brought up. "
"Dudes that have a run like him in the tourney always get buzz. But yea. Don't know how active you are in the local hoops scene, but I ref AAU games and people have been up on him since he was like 12. "
"He was great his last year, got the Wolves to be a top 10 offense and a top 12 defense with only Love and Pek protecting the paint. He's the best coach the Wolves have had, and far better than Flip. "
"Basically they are really good when healthy. Mainly rubio, our numbers show how much better we are when he is on the court. Pek on the other hand is decent but super injury prone. Kahn gave them both huge contracts so it's going to be impossible to trade them so that's where we are at. We just have to wait until peks contract is up and we will be good. I still want rubio and think he is a good asset "
"Fool me once......"
"Why will Rubio inevitably get injured? He has 2 bad injuries sandwiched between playing 130 consecutive games. "
"Then we'll get 46ish"
"Okafor's footwork and agility on offense reminds me of Duncan. He has more ballhandling than Duncan, though, similar to Shaq or Blake Griffin, but not nearly as explosive or powerful as either of those two. On defense, I'm not sure. I can't think of somebody that large who was bad at defense, although Okafor is certainly flat-footed and lacks awareness on that end. Probably Al Jefferson on defense is the closest I can think of.

Towns does remind me of LMA. I don't think he's nearly as athletic as Ibaka or Noah, though he seems like he'll fill out and be heavier than both of them

Edit: I see /u/aSc4rYGh0sT already came to the same conclusion on Okafor."
"I love this KG moment. Reporter asks a question, KG completely snubs her to be a weirdo."
"Touche that's true and we lost a lot so what was the point of rushing him last season. I think he will have a good season if he doesn't get hurt "
"That's not really true man. Look at a squad like Milwaukee. They obviously got a better situation with coaching, but they don't have anybody as good as Love. Not even close. The right group of role players can go .500."
"&gt; Kahn gave them both huge contracts

Rubio's current contract came from Flip."
"Okafor is bigger, a better passer, has a softer touch, and is a much better ball-handler than Jefferson. I would say his floor is Al Jefferson, and I'm not saying that lightly. Also, there are not many dudes that are 270 with a 7'5"" wingspan. He has room to improve on defense.

All that said, I like Towns' versatility and the fact that his game doesn't have any holes. Okafor will probably always be a poor shooter due to his huge hands, which is certainly a limitation to take into consideration."
"Man that is a minority opinion lol. Petersen is awesome. He's one of the best x's and o's guys in the league as far as broadcasters go, he always has interesting stories and anecdotes about the players and franchises, he's positive without being a homer... I mean, it's not just us in Minnesota that like him. Go in /r/nba game threads - fans from other teams that watch on league pass will often leave comments like ""this Wolves color guy is great"" and he has been recognized by national media including Zach Lowe from Grantland for being very good at his job."

"We lived through the David Khan. That's why people are so hesitant around picks. It's not that we don't trust Flip, we're just damaged goods leftover after Khan.
 "
"[This guy seems to agree with you](http://hoopshabit.com/2015/05/20/r-j-hunter-steal-2015-nba-draft/)"
"I see this list as much more McHale's influence. I blame him for KG never getting a title here."
"Payne has much greater defensive potential and seems to give effort. Bennett does not seem to give effort and hasn't really improved in a couple years in the league.

I'm sure you can see why someone might think Payne is the obvious bet to improve next year, not Bennett."
"Ugh, 2 out of 5 players is bad enough, but with those you are going down swinging. We got Bobby Jackson and Dean Garrett for the traded pick, that's like couple of field goals. 

but those forfeited picks are like called third strikes. 

Basketball man"
"Wait? Are you trying to suggest that the players deserve some credit for being good? Get out of town"
"45"
"As much as we need more wings, I think we have better options. "
"I think we're more likely to trade Bjelica than sign him"
"Flip is a better coach than Adleman was for the Wolves.  Adleman was totally checked out and also actively hindered the development of his young players."
"Yes and no. There's this idea that Flip is some great coach that has a long history of developing players. Even though there isn't much proof of him developing good players. "
"[Preach](http://images.rapgenius.com/a91e822ad401f1fda29b2a146817d68d.552x464x1.jpg)"
"Flip is worse at coaching offense and defense than Adelman. Bull shit on the hindrance of development quip. "
"That's right.  Everybody at the time was surprised that Flip was so aggressive in locking Pek down, basically making an opening offer that he knew nobody was going to chase after.

If Pek wasn't made of glass, that actually would have panned out to be a pretty awesome contract.  Alas."
"Honestly, looking at where we picked none of those picks are that bad. For a few of the real busts you can make a good case that we were trying to hit a home run when we should have just tried to hit a single.

The forfeitures are brutal though. I think in hindsight the punishment for the Joe Smith fiasco was way over the top. If it had happened to the Lakers. Celtics, or Knicks there would have been riots."
"I don't want Olynyk...

:/"
"He could stretch the floor, make hustle plays, donate his hair to some Minnesotan kid with cancer, rip off the arm of any opposing bigs....

Come on now man"
"I hope he's not as soft of Mozgod."
"If he's so great, why do you want to get rid of him?"
"Pls Flip."
"Gotta spread the talent around 

Seriously though, Olynyk is an underrated player. He'd be a good back up for KAT and Pekovic. He could play with either one too, unlike Dieng."
"Trade back to what, the mid first round? 

How exactly do you see a trade like this going down?"
"Ive noticed that all the writers for lakers are saturating the Okafor thing, is that the case in the subreddit too?   "
"Nah we would've been better than that last year if we could stay healthy. I'm guessing around 40 wins if rubio can stay healthy"
"If you are going to come in here with a trade proposal, at least have some reasons for why we should."
"He reminds me a lot of Lavine actually."
"Is that to reflect his age?"
"Of course he says that. Can we not do this for the next month?"
"Really nice write up.  I think we are taking Towns and god I hope we do.  It seems to me that Okafor is trying to avoid going to Minnesota(saying its not important to be first overall, not sure if the interview was done before or after lotto,) where Towns seems to want to play(or atleast play with wiggins).  The fit and the fact that he is at worst equal talent to Okafor, points to me that we have to take him.  We wont know until draft night since Flip is smoke screening but I think he will take towns. "
"Nah. Gorgui is pretty much my life."
"Draft him, Flip!"
"The hypothetical in the title mean nothing to you?
"
"I'd rather have Olynyk over Dieng. Better offensive capabilities plus a better role player.

We overrate the shit out of Dieng."
"Under 40."
"Well I saw a report that Okafor will tell the Wolves not to draft him, so if that's the truth give me one Notorious K.A.T. who I have wanted all along. "
"I think we should try to trade for Devin Booker. Best shooter in the draft and can defend. He is also only 18. "
"Around 25 is my guess. I hope we can have a top 10 pick for next year, too, to draft a good/correct SF in case we trade for Tyus or another correct backup PG (or in case we trade for vets).

Realistically, I don't see us having much health (because it wasn't the case the last 4 years), and I don't think we are actually so good yet. Towns will be a rookie and the Maple Jordan and Space Jam will still be sophomores. Weck, even Bazz, Dieng and Payne are under 25."
"I honestly think Olynyk fits with KAT/Okafor and Pek better than Dieng. Obviously, trading Pekovic is preferable, but good luck on that end. And an early second rounder isn't nothing, a risk free flyer on a high upside Euro"
"People are riding the march madness hype train. He shot 30% from 3 pointers this year....Don't get me wrong I loved watching him play, but he have a slump year, the only reason he is leaving is because of the hype train he got a ticket to."
"The whole, ""They dont want to play in MN"" is all BS. I mean how many players have actually refused to play or even stay here? Not many, and far far fewer (I pay attention Stannis) than is projected by the jackals. Of course being a 20 year old and having a choice you are going to go to a big city but when you get here, get huge money, have kids and all that Minny is a great place. Fucking media trying to stir the pot is all "
"I like RJ Ryan.  He is a hell of a shooter but he might be drafted as high as the teens
"
"77 percent doesn't mean anything in a vacuum. What's the league average?"
"Until this year, Pek had missed the league average amount of games for a 7 footer. Hopefully he can return to that after this recent surgery."
"&gt; Mentions that Martin could come off the bench

He should really just be traded. A three player rotation of LaVine, Wiggins, and Shabazz works really well and eats up all 96 minutes per game at the SG and SF. Sticking Martin into that rotation means that both LaVine and Shabazz are getting fewer minutes than they should and/or LaVine is forced to play out of position at PG. 

&gt; On bumper to bumper Flip also said that the problem with our 3pt shooting this year was a lot of shots were contested, and a big guy who demands a double team (alluding to Okafor) give the shooters the room they need by drawing defenders inside.

Someone should ask Flip who the big guy drawing double teams for GS is?"
"With everything I'm seeing I'm actually cautiously optimistic. I was honestly around 50-50 right after the lottery, but now I'm about 80-20 in favor of Towns. We can only hope. "
"amen, do you mean everything you are seeing?"
"Really God damn well, that's how well...

His game is even more effective over here, in fact. "
"Lebron and the Brow were both can't miss, assuming they stayed healthy. But I know what you mean, Towns is not at their level (relatively close compared to some first overalls I'd argue, though.)"
"He does struggle against those guys, but he also isn't wrong. "
"Kornheiser trashed us yesterday on PTI as well. Not saying it's right at all, but that's just the way it is from the LA-Dallas-NY circlejerk that is ESPN. Don't let it get to you, otherwise they win, amirite"
"He shot 30% on 7.5 attempts a game while being double teamed.  Stats don't tell the story on this kids shot.  Kid played 37 minutes a game.  The threes he'd be taking in the NBA would be much easier than the ones he took in college.
"
"You dont wanna let Towns drop lol smh"
"Why ""screw you philly"" ...?"
"They do it to everyone dont worry"
"Point-Center"
"He sounds like he's leaning towards Towns, but I think he sees Okafor as an attractive prospect. 

Towns looks like he's keen to come here and Okafor, by all accounts, sounds reluctant. I have no doubt that that'll impact Flip's decision, especially if Okafor refuses to do a private workout here.

I was happy to hear how he kept mentioning Rubio, LaVine and Wiggins as our current core of players and that the pick would be made to make sure we could get a player that would benefit them and benefit from them. He acknowledges that Zach's future is at the 2 and I think he's open to giving him the start next season.

Not sure about Tyus. I'd prefer to take the risk on Upshaw for pure basketball reasons and the fact that good backup PGs grow on trees in this league. My ideal situation would be to draft Towns, trade for Tyus and get Upshaw in a trade or with the 31st."
"Aye, haha, just burned one so I'm a little scattered. "
"my only stat is solely based on something I remembered Mike and Mike talking about one morning 2 months ago. I really liked watching him play, but you can't say they would be easier threes. Georgia State  is apart of the Sun Belt Con. not one of the elite playing levels in college basketball. Ontop of that is also the fact that he would be playing against the best players in the world. Also the 3 point line is farther back in the NBA as well. All I am saying is that he will have a hard time transitioning into the nba, not saying most players don't but I don't think we should trade back when KAT or JO are about as close to locks to be good players."
"This article confirms to me that Towns should play at the 5 and the Wolves should either trade Pek or monitor his minutes on the bench."
"I pray this is what okafor does."
"I know they won't do this but they could reply something mean, like Russell was our second choice, work on those free throws."
"While he should play at the 5, I wouldn't mind him playing at the 4 for a while so Pek could possibly boost his trade value so we don't lose him for nothing."
"Source pls."
"Well, it's basically the opposite of what Okafor said, so it's *kinda* news-worthy."
"He'll be fringe first rounder.  If we can get him in the 2nd I would not be upset."
"On a phone but here is the story I [read](http://www.dukebasketballreport.com/2015/5/21/8633423/report-jahlil-okafor-doesnt-want-to-play-for-t-wolves)

As I said, if true oh well."
"Wally was an all-star, don't sell him as just ""startable"""
"I think Rubio's contract looks a lot better going forward if he can stay healthy.  If I remember, it is pretty long, and with the new collective bargaining agreement, salaries are going to go up pretty significantly, so it will look like a lot more of a bargain.  Pek is so nice to watch when he's healthy, but its frustrating how rare it is that he is actually healthy.

"
"Loved me some Wally. Dude was such a shot maker. "
"I would rather just use the first overall pick and draft a guy who will give us interior defense (Towns). "
"Woohoo! Toasted ravs! Farty Far! Murder! Nelly!"
"I didn't make this to start a war in the pack, I just wanted to see what the general consensus in here is. I know my flair says otherwise but I want predictions on how history will go down on our first #1 pick."
"brilliant "
"I played against him when i was a junior and he was an 8th grader he has a natural eye for the game. His court vision is insane."
"There's already been something like this just as a heads up "
"[deleted]"
"cause he's totally the guy everybody expected him to be coming into the league? He was the number 1 ranked pg in 09 over Steph Jrue Holiday Ty Lawson Jeff Teague.  "
"One year only. For most of his career he was ""startable"" at best. But I loooove how he could be counted on to fill up that bucket!"
"Well actually this is huge. Taylor said they wanted someone with a good heart. Well KAT is the better player, and he WANTS to be here, when Okafor doesnt. That is just better for our chances of hm being picked."
"Kahn did not give out huge contracts - even if one was warranted.  That was the one good thing about the Kahn era, there were few if any big, bad contracts.   "
"Sounds about right.

Oh, and sup /woo/."
"Bjelica, 31, and 36 for T Jones. Interesting.

I'd rather go Bjelica personally. But I'm not a pro scout so who knows."
"Son of a bitch. Just HAD to remind me of Ebi."
"He's totally the guy everyone expected- one of the best passers and craftiest game managers in the league with a questionable shot. An absolute wizard on the court, and a difference maker. His defense is way better than advertised and he's better than we could have hoped. Just because some other guys are really good, including the mvp, doesn't mean Rubio was a bad pick. "
"This.
People get so wrapped up in the reddit group think. If you suggest Okafor is better, you must be  a fucking idiot. 

There will be tons of scouting and research done by the coaching staff, I trust the organization to make the right decision.

P.s. I hope it's KAT"
"Hah this is a ridiculous statement, there were nights we had the minimum possible players available. He played whoever he had as much as they could because they were the only options. "
"I was looking at a Bleacher Report article that predicted the top 20 players in 2020, and Wiggins was at 2, and Okafor (Lower than Towns, so I'm using him for this example) was 18. 

I looked at a thing that ranked the top 50 Players of 2015. At two was Kevin Durant, and 18 was John Wall.

Pretty sweet right?"

"Flip has also done a lot of things wrong. And calling Lavine, Bazz, or Dieng actual good NBA players at this stage is just incorrect. Look back at guys who've made 2nd team all rookie through the years. Includes such Wolves greats as Jonny Flynn, Wesley Johnson, and Derrick Williams. It's basically the next five rookies you can name. It means nothing. 

Having a healthy dose of skepticism towards the guy with unlimited organizational power is absolutely necessary considering he flat out doesn't have the track record to deserve it. The fact that there's a clear consensus that KAT is the better prospect but its still somehow 50-50 who we take doesn't concern you?"
"(I hope we draft number 19, purely for their name)

By consensus you mean reddit and FB comments?


The experts are still fairly split.



I agree that we shouldnt blindly trust flip, tho, and I personally prefer Towns."
"Forfeited?

So we could lose our pick due to stupidity?"
"&gt;It seems to me that Okafor is trying to avoid going to Minnesota(saying its not important to be first overall, not sure if the interview was done before or after lotto,)

"I don't think Towns is the consensus #1 at all. At this point, I'm not sure who I'd want between him and Okafor, but i'd be satisfied with either one.

Plus, we traded Trey Burke for Bazz and Dieng, which is looking better and better every day. "
"Its like 75-25 Towns at this point"
"No, the experts are not split. DX, ESPN, Hoopshype, NBAdraft, basically any place with actual scouts dedicated to this all have Towns as the #1.

"Id say more 60-40 but yeah, my main point is it's definitely not a ""consensus"""
"Draftexpress and ESPN have Towns at #1. In their respective write ups of their mocks they say the scouts consensus is Towns is #1, and Flip is the last decision maker to have Okafor as a potential #1. Most experts I've seen in there mocks that have Okafor going to the Wolves is because of Flip's perceived preference.  "
"arsenic "
"&gt;No, the experts are not split. DX, ESPN, Hoopshype, NBAdraft, basically any place with actual scouts dedicated to this all have Towns as the #1. 

There's certainly more for Towns, Im just saying it's not a ""consensus"".

&gt;A tweet like [this](https://twitter.com/chadfordinsider/status/600826954519080960) should be concerning. 

So far, all this ""Flip is leaning Okafor"" rumor seems to be stemming solely from that weak @draftexpress tweet.

And every other outlet is just running with it.

"ok thank you.  I was looking for the source and when he said it.  There are however other sources that say he doesnt want to come to minnesota.  But thanks for saying if the interview was before or after"
"Im just basing it on the expert panel response article I saw specifically about the Twolves pick that ended up being split 6-4 in favor of Towns.  And a few other 'experts' have picked Okafor, too, like the guy on punchdrunkwolves.


Certainly, more people are picking  Towns, though, Im not saying they arent "
"Yeah, in todays social media age people just take shit and run with it.


Iirc Okafor had to make tweet earlier today specifying that he said that before the lottery."
"I'll take this prediction with a grain of salt. While I agree that prediction is extremely exciting, its also coming from bleacher report. Bleacher report isn't the most creditable source for getting valuable information/analysis of players. But thats no fun, KAT and Wiggins are leading T-wolves to the championship in 2020!!  "
"Kevin McHale made an under the table illegal deal with Joe Smith where the Wolves were going to give Smith three 1 year deals for very little money so they could acquire his bird rights while simultaneously make other roster moves with the free space. The league found out about this when Joe Smith's agent got into a legal dispute with a former partner of the agency. David Stern took away 5 first rounders from the Wolves (Wolves later got 2 of them back)."
"That article was such bullshit. KD is waaay too low."
"Bazz was basically universally crushed as a colossal mistake, Gorgi was some kid a lot of us had never even heard of, they didn't ride in on a huge hype train, they crawled in unnoticed and unloved.  They've been legitimately good contributors, not just maybe future capable players, they've looked good now.  

Lavine the jury is still out and I'm not saying Bazz and Dieng have made it yet either, but you can't act like they are complete wildcards that have been just been blindly supported because they were top picks like the 3 guys you mentioned"
"There is valid reasons to choose both guys. I prefer KAT but I wouldn't be mad at all if we went with Okafor. "
"That's absolutely true.   There are some articles saying jahilal Okafor does not want to come here.  Now I question how true these are but I wouldnt mind them being true so we can draft big KAT. http://www.dukebasketballreport.com/2015/5/21/8633423/report-jahlil-okafor-doesnt-want-to-play-for-t-wolves "
"I didn't say they were wild cards. I was responding to the OP that counted those three as points in the win column already for Flip. Calling them 'good' contributors is disingenuous since they were 'contributing' to the single worst team in the league. To claim those picks as Flip victories already is willful ignorance of basic facts. I like Bazz the best but I'm not remotely ready to crown anyone. The only guy we have right now who is clear-cut guaranteed to be here in 3 years is Wiggins. Full stop. Those three could easily still not work out for a variety of reasons"
"Turns out this was pretty east to do in excel. You were right, 77.7% doesn't really mean much. 80.3% is the league average, so we are shooting slightly more contested 3s vs uncontested 3s. I probably should've done this before writing that part above. Good catch.

EDIT: [here's all teams](http://i.imgur.com/IVjj2ZB.png). Twolves take the 5th highest percentage of contested 3s. So flip has a point."

I'm not saying we trade back to get him, I'm saying we use our second rounder and K-mart to trade back up for him.  Dude's stroke is pure, has underrated passing abilities.  I firmly believe that if we add this kid, he could do everything K-Mart can do plus a little bit more.  


I don't care if he was in the sun belt, when he is the NBA will Andrew Wiggins, Towns, and Shabazz be ahead of him in terms the scouting report?  Absolutely.  This kid can do everything offensively.  I may be in love with him, but he can pass, shoot and handle (oxford comma).  Would be the perfect guy to spread the floor for Wigs to work in the post.  


Honestly, my crush on him goes beyond words.  If i were Detroit I would pick him at 8.  If i were Charlotte I'd pick him at nine.  If i were Indiana I'd pick him at 11.  Goes on and on, with today's new age NBA who couldn't use a guy who can space the floor with decent playmaking.  

"
"Yeah. I think even the most irrational laker fans are now starting to accept that we aren't getting towns. This of course is leading to a bunch of posts on why Okafor is the better prospect haha. "

"Not to mention seemingly *all* the fans want KAT over Okafor. I've gotten that feel from Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, casual conversation... Come on, Flip. Don't fuck this up."
"KAT = multiple 3-peats, Okafor = lottery team for 10 more years

Side note: slight preference for towns"
"Minneapolis is seriously on the come up as far as big cities go too. "
"[deleted]"
"KAT doesn't *want* to be in Minn. But he recognizes that it's a privilege to play in the NBA and an honor to be the 1st overall pick. Given the choice, I highly doubt he would pick the wolves. 

Doesn't mean he won't give the team his all. "
"&gt; Wolves should either trade Pek or monitor his minutes on the bench.

The Wolves should do this regardless of who is picked. "
"Signing Pek to a 5 year deal when nobody else made an offer was a bad move in hindsight. Other injury prone guys like Turiaf and Martin were brought on, and yes, have been injured a lot. He also signed Bud and Rubio to long-term deals after major knee injuries. I point this out because in every interview, Flip says the Wolves have been cursed by injuries. Not exactly true, Flip"
"That's a worse punishment than the Patriots got. Cheap rookie contracts are vital"
"Neither the story you linked to nor the story that story linked to had any direct actual information about Okafor not wanting to come here. It's all BS 3rd hand speculation."
"Except Okafor has never said anything like that. It's all speculation and rumor. "
"Flip has done a decent job personnel-wise for the most part. I just wish he would fire the coach."
"Guy on punchdrunkwolves is not an expert, he is a blogger with an opinion who writes on a site with decent traffic. "
"Preach "
"I posted this somewhere else, but it fits here better
The reason most of us are so on edge and uncomfortable is that for one, we haven't had the number 1 pick before, and two, we lived through the David Khan years. It's hard to feel optimistic on a good pick when you've seen them wasted on Derrick Williams, Johnny Flynn, and Michael Beasley.

For the most part Flip has been great as POBO. No matter what we should end up doing well, but it's difficult to not be anxious while sitting in the drivers seat of the whole draft."
"I would be okay with trading up into the first round to get someone the likes of Tyus Jones, or Hunter. But there are also some guys project to go somewhere in the second round that I would like us to develop and see what they can do as well. Like The Andrew Harrison, Rashad Vaughn or Pat Macaughton."
"As Jalen says, "" you've got to give the people what they want"". They've managed to get more and more popular in an ever changing world. If people wanted rational analysis, they would surely provide it "
"Flip is the shit I honestly think he is a mastermind. Always trying to make some crazy deals to make us a great team and get us over the hump"
"First, it should be 50-50 as far the public is concerned. Why would any team show their cards earlier than necessary. So, no, that 50-50 perception doesn't concern me and it shouldn't concern you.

Second, Flip has done a lot of things that didn't pan out, and so does every GM. That doesn't make it ""wrong."" You make the best decision based on the information at hand, and that goes beyond talent to include coachability, drive, and fit with the team. 

Finally, ""experts"" inaccurately evaluate players/deals about as often as GMs, so I don't put stock in that either. I think the ""experts"" thought Oden was hands down the better pick of Durant, and look how that turned out. 

I want KAT over Okafor--I watched both in the tournament and he just seemed way better. BUT, this mindset of ""Flip's a moron if he doesn't take KAT, end of story"" is just delusional. "
"Upvoted, then downvoted for the edit."
"DonnieDarkoMilicic clearly wants no part of those rational, level-headed thoughts. Either KAT's the consensus, it's a 50-50 split, or Okafor's the consensus, there's no in between (don't try to confuse him with nuances). 

He's got one message, and one message only: KAT or GTFO!? That goes for you, too, Flip. "
"It's their perception of Flip's perceived preference."
"Didn't care. Still dont"
"The edit and reply would prove otherwise."
"It is going to be fun watching Okafor and Pek play together "
"I mean that's what the ""experts"" are too.  Just writers making an estimated opinion.

Even so that takes away one person out of about 8 or so Ive seen."
"I'm going to be so nervous that we won't take Towns for the next month/until Flip announces it"
"I don't even know how to react to this. I want to slap you but I'm 99% sure you're just making a point that we shouldn't draft Okafor (which I agree with.)"
"Having been to this rodeo a couple times I hate to break it to you but you need to hunker down for a month long shitstorm of speculation.  At least you have a pretty clear choice with 2 great candidates at a position you could use.  That '13 draft when we took Bennett was miserable and it seemed like the media was spinning a wheel to decide who should get drafted on any given day.

There's a lot of time for speculation, tape review, and workouts.  Don't take anything further out than a week from draft day too seriously and trust that your front office will be making an informed decision on what's best for the team.  It's always possible you could get a bust but with the top pick you have the best chance at a great player even if it doesn't turn out to be a franchise player.

Relax. Ride it out.  Get hype for next season."
"Perfect! New sidebar image, mods!"
"If we draft KAT there wont be many teams that will be able to match the skill set of our starters.  Imagine having to guard both Shabazz and Wiggins on the wings.  Shabazz is the physical dominant bruising post up type wing player.  Wiggins is the out of this world athletic winger.  Then we would have two big men that completely compliment eachother.  Pekovic is a bruiser who is hard to keep off the glass and KAT would be a stretch big man who can protect the rim and provide good help defense.  All of this coupled with the 99 skill cape wizard named Rubio we are really going to be a hard matchup in a few years for any team."
"I'm all for speculation, just not the ""KAT or GTFO"" comments."
"* Yea I have to agree with this but imagine if we would have had him a few years earlier...
* Curry instead of Flynn
* Paul George instead of wes johnson
* Klay Thompson instead of Derrick Williams
* We also would have been able to keep love with this core of players.  Most likely would have been the best team in the nba since the 60s Celtics."
"Take it outside sir, this is a level headed establishment!"
"I agree, I'm actually moving back to Minneapolis from Eden Prairie this July. I needed to be closer to my team"
"needs &gt;2 rims"
"I remember some talk coming out of HS, Tyus was open to the idea of staying home for the Gophers but only if he could convince Okafor to come with him. Naturally, Okafor gave a big hell no to that. While I don't know if either of those things are actually true, in my head they will be.  
  
With that in mind, it would be holy retribution if he was now forced to come to Minnesota and Tyus was drafted by us as well."
"We didn't draft Beasley, but I see what you're saying. Kahn has put a bad taste in everyone's mouth I think."
"Try Timberwolves PR twitter, they could potentially get you in touch with someone"
"Hell, and a 6th man in Zach Lavine who can go to the rim as he pleases with his elite athleticism. And if he develops his jumper in the offseason that will be deadly."

"Marvin Williams was dumber. Paul or Deron Williams.

It's funny because Marc Gasol was in the same draft and Oden was supposed to be better than current Marc, but they'd take him in Portland and it would be a justified no. 1 overall. And Noah obviously does well for Chicago, probably would with Portland. Or his knee would be dust, who knows.

Did they use Prz in 2005-06? I see why they wanted Oden and they would try to get someone like Batum at SF, which happened. Oden was supposed to recover like Stoudemire and not score 27, but defensively stop someone like that and get his 18-12.

The Clippers were dumb taking Korolev in 2006, but in 2008 they get Jordan in the 2nd round."
"I'll get downvoted for this but I think there is a lot that goes on behind the scenes before the draft that we dont hear about.  

I'm sure the agents of some players have told our organization that their client won't play for the franchise due to the city its in.  There were reports that Shaq and Curry's agents told the Wolves they wouldn't play for them and force a trade."
"Diaw and Stoudemire had to play together sometimes without Marion. Big Al didn't stop them, but he also scored 40."
"I disagree with you. Flip has made a couple of nice decisions, but also a couple of mistakes (like trading a first for Thad Young). For me, he hasn't proved anything and has to keep working for me to blindly trust him as I trust, say, the Spurs or the Heat organizations."
"Agree. I went on the ""Towns or die"" train for a while, because our team hasn't defend in the last years and pairing a promised great defender with Wiggins sounded simply like a great defensive team but then I realized that Okafor and Wiggins would be equally effective offensively, so I'm not worried who we draft now. I slightly prefer Towns to Okafor, but a healthy Al Horford is not that much better than a healthy Big Al, who was also dominant during the PO last season. And this, assuming these are the comparisons from both KAT and Okafor, but of course they are different people so we don't know what will happen (see Milicic or Wes Johnson)."
"Greg Oden was the best big man prospect since Shaq. If his knees would have held up he would have been an all star. Injuries are the variable that no one can ever be certain with. Portland made the right choice picking Oden #1 and if they haven't picked him they would have went with Durant, not Gasol or Noah."
"You continue to put words in my mouth. Nowhere have I said anyone is an idiot for preferring Okafor. I'm sure he'll be a solid pro- if we were picking second I'd be happy with getting him. But guess what? We aren't picking second. We have our choice of every available player. We absolutely have to get this right and the available evidence clearly favors Towns as both the superior prospect and a much better scheme fit here. When the biggest defense of Okafor is just 'trust Flip because he's done so well,' then that is concerning"
"You skipped Duncan, though that is long before Oden. 

Right, swap health and Oden does well. The top picks in that era were usually guys like Yao, Okafor, Bogut and then not Aldridge for Colangelo's weird reasons. Don't stack rebounding and use Bosh's shooting, skill. Rose with Noah, obviously over Beasley or Love.

Thabeet way too high, huge bust for Memphis not getting all the way to the Finals."

"Then give a passive aggressive comment about their attitude and go to the 5-8 Club for some Juicy Lucies "
"Yeah, but he's  not an exception. Look at the [list of #1 picks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_overall_NBA_draft_picks) -- it seems like big men have had a tendency to flop. In addition to Oden's injuries (can't really call that a flop, more of an unfortunate bust), there's Bargnani, Kwame Brown, and Olowokandi who never made an all-star game. 

It's just hard to predict these things. But, the #1 pick also has a lot of excitement surrounding it (about 2/3 of the players on that list above went on to be all-stars). "
"No self respecting Minnesotan goes to 5-8 for a Luicy. "
"Any idea how I can contact them?"
"Someone asked me where I read that- I gave them the story I read. I realize it's third hand speculation, as I've said - If its true, oh well. KAT is willing to play anywhere he is drafted and IF the Okafor thing is true (Big IF) I dont think its a big deal.  "

"If we would have drafted Curry we wouldn't have had the opportunity to draft the likes of those players, and even if we did, very few would have taken Paul George 4th overall at the time, and Klay Thompson would not have gone #2 in that draft without knowing what we know now"
"Hindsight is 20/20, but Oden has one leg longer than the other. It causes him to wear an insert at all times and is significant enough that it looks like he walks with a limp.

And there was talk of him maybe having an injury riddled career, but the doctors thought that wouldn't effect him. That misdiagnosis combined with his talent and size was just too much for Portland to pass up."
"[You heard me](http://i.imgur.com/txA9C4J.gif)"
"82-0!"
"KAT down low with Wiggins defending on the wing has the makings of a top 3 defense in a few years.  Add another lottery pick next year (say, a stretch 4 who can defend or a 3/D wing) and that's a very impressive young core.  

And, btw, Pek will either be out of the league, on another team, or in steep decline by the time MN is a playoff contender in a few years."

"why do you entirely dislike him. I am just wondering?"
"&gt; collaborated on this very pretty play

I'm not sure pretty is the word I would use, but damn did it get me hot and bothered watching that"
"True, but he can't defend when he's in street clothes.  "
"Does anybody else think they should do the fucking draft one week after the lottery?  Wouldn't have to deal with stories like this for the next month"
"Please no. We need defense."
"I agree a lot, but players aren't usually dumb enough to go to the media about it and its more of a suggestion than a demand. They become free agents in 4 years, so if they are dead set against playing they will say to the owner/GM whoever, I will most likely leave after the 4. The GM has to find a player who will stay or who isn't really committed to a place and might find they like it. There are way more players who just want to play in the NBA than players who want to dictate where, they just want to win and we haven't been a winning team in a long time so I understand some hesitation, but I also see a solid future if we hold this team together and Flip can do that better than anyone else we have had here. Also I am downvoting you because your first five words. I hate that. have a good weekend!"

"I agree, usually wait for them to get it uploaded to their youtube channel. "
"KAT is a center bro. Either him or Okafor would start along with KG. Then we sub in Dieng and Payne at either position. Add in Pek when he's healthy. "
"He's one of the best off ball defenders in the NBA bruh. We can live with it."
"Pek is irrelevant. Good chance Wolves fight for medical retirement next summer."
"Personally, I liked him and I continue to like his game and his potential as an NBA player, but I'm annoyed at all the reports of him not wanting to come here and asking not to be drafted by us.

If he doesn't want to come here, then we shouldn't want him here. We should be looking for players that actually want to be here."

"Yeah it can be frustrating"
"Okafor: Muggsy Bogues
Towns: Penny Hardaway
What?"
"I have ZERO faith in Flip. He turned Love into Wiggins through sheer dumb luck. If Lebron wanted Wiggins, Wiggins would have stayed, period. This sub gives Lavine way too much praise for what was a fairly disastrous season. He is incredibly raw and won't make significant contributions for several years if he does at all. It's too early to call it, but Lavine in our starting lineup is not a comforting thought to me. Lavine was Flip's draft. We traded a 1st round draft pick, in essence, for a 39 year old KG with one limited season left of legs. The jury is still out on both Muhammed and Dieng. There is no reason to have faith in Flip and I'm terrified the Wolves will fuck up this pick like they've fucked up the past decade of basketball. We have every reason to be cynical, we haven't made the playoffs in over a decade. The apologists need to start expecting a little more from this team. "
"If this isn't sarcasm, I don't know what is anymore."
"He runs an embarrassingly dated offense. "
"KAT is the choice. "
"I will curse Flip to my grave if we don't take Towns."
"**Towns**:

Best: He develops his offensive to equal his defense and becomes a consistent All-Star. I think his ceiling is a very balanced player. Kinda like a worse Tim Duncan.

Worst: He doesn't develop his game to match the pro level. He becomes a rim protector and defensive specialist. 

**Okafor**:

Best: He becomes the best offensive center in the game. He is able to shoot well and draw doubles almost every possession. His defense develops to be sufficient. 

Worst: His offense suffers against better competition. He routinely gets worked in the paint by other centers. 

Personally I think that I would rather have Towns because even if he busts, which does happen more often with big men drafted high, he would have more value as a defensive player and still contribute. "
"Lets also consider where we were drafting in the 1st, its not like those were top 10 picks, we were a playoff team during those years. Match where they picked that year to other draft years and you'd probably see that they are very similier, just hard to find guys outside the lottery. Would have rather had Mchale drafting with the picks had in the Kahn era, lets not forget he left us with Klove and Pek before he was let go, imagine how awful things would have been for us if it wasn't for Mchales last draft here."
"Right, then you show you can win and in 4 years he may want to re-sign. "

"ESPN Insider's Chad Ford and Kevin Pelton return to provide the kind of discussions that are happening in front offices around the NBA -- where scouts and statistical experts are breaking down NBA draft prospects using their ""eyes, ears and numbers.""

Following Tuesday's NBA draft lottery, we finally have the official order for the 2015 draft. Both Chad and Kevin have their own Big Boards and now it's time for them to play general manager, weighing in on the best fits for teams making the first four picks: the Timberwolves, Lakers, 76ers and Knicks. 

First up: the Minnesota Timberwolves

If you were drafting for the Timberwolves, whom would you take No. 1?



Ford: Karl-Anthony Towns. I think five guys in this draft are worthy of the No. 1 pick, but the choice in Minnesota would be an easy one for me. Not only do I think Towns is the best player in the draft, but I also think he fits a need. The Wolves have a talented young point guard in Ricky Rubio and a dynamic wing in Andrew Wiggins, so what they need now is a dominant big. Towns' ability to score inside and out, combined with his rim-protection abilities, make him the perfect choice. Yes, they have Gorgui Dieng and Nikola Pekovic, but Pekovic isn't going to be a big part of their future. Plus, I think that because of Towns' versatility, he and Dieng could play together.

Pelton: Agreed on Towns. Last season opponents shot a league-high 67.2 percent against the Timberwolves in the restricted area, per NBA.com/Stats, a number that figures to come down with Towns patrolling the rim. While I think Dieng has the potential to be a full-time starter down the road, let me throw out this possible partner for Towns in the frontcourt: Nemanja Bjelica, the Serbian forward Minnesota acquired in the second round of the 2010 draft who was recently named Euroleague MVP. Bjelica projects as an above-average NBA player based on his translated European statistics.


The Los Angeles Lakers have the next pick. Whom would you take No. 2?

Ford: That's a much tougher one, but my first instinct is to say Jahlil Okafor. The Lakers could use a center and Okafor is going to be a beast on offense. But I don't know that he's an ideal fit next to last year's lottery pick, Julius Randle. And I think it would be tough to pass on D'Angelo Russell or even Emmanuel Mudiay here. Jordan Clarkson had a great rookie season but he's not the talent that Russell or Mudiay is. The Lakers could especially use Russell's shooting. I'm going to stick with Okafor but it's very, very close between him, Russell and Mudiay.

Pelton: In the event the Timberwolves take Okafor, the Lakers should rush to pick Towns as soon as possible. Don't even use the whole five minutes -- too risky! Otherwise, I'm leaning toward Russell. The Ohio State guard comes out as the best prospect in the draft by my WARP projections, and I have too many questions about Okafor's ability to anchor a top defense. Though he had a promising rookie season, I don't think Clarkson is good enough to sway me from going with the best player available.


The Philadelphia 76ers are on the clock with the third pick. Whom would you take?

Ford: Russell. I actually think Sixers fans can take a deep breath that they ended up with the third pick. With Okafor and Towns off the board, they're free to address their biggest need in the backcourt. I'm a huge Mudiay fan, but the Sixers really need shooting assistance and I think Russell's confidence will be a huge boon for them. He's a leader in a way that Michael Carter-Williams never was.

Pelton: I love the fit of Russell in Philadelphia. He can be the perimeter counterweight Philadelphia needs to balance its promising young big men. In this scenario, with Russell off the board, I think I would go Mudiay because I'm not convinced Okafor is a better prospect than a healthy Joel Embiid. The really bold move (if the draft played out like this) would be for general manager Sam Hinkie to take Okafor and try to extract a ransom from the New York Knicks for him, along the lines of last year's Elfrid Payton-Dario Saric swap that netted the Sixers the return of their protected 2017 first-round pick plus the 35th pick in this year's draft.


Finally, the New York Knicks have the fourth pick. Any hope left in Gotham?

Ford: Absolutely. I really am a big fan of Mudiay and think he has the game and maturity to be a star in New York. He's not a great fit in the triangle, but I don't think you can pass on him just because of that. The Knicks need a potential star and I believe Mudiay could be one -- and sooner than later. I'll also point out here that on my own Big Board, Kristaps Porzingis is very worthy of this pick. I just don't know that they can take him in New York without getting booed out of the city.

Pelton: In my scenario, New York would still land Okafor despite dropping to the fourth pick, which would be an excellent result. In reality, Okafor will probably be off the board, leaving the Knicks choosing between Mudiay and Porzingis. Let me make the case for Porzingis. Having succeeded against far tougher competition in Spain, he figures to have more immediate impact, and he's only seven months older than Mudiay. Also, I have some concerns about how well Mudiay -- a poor shooter whose best attribute will probably be running the pick-and-roll -- will fit in the triangle offense. There's flexibility there, but a pick-and-roll-heavy style isn't what team president Phil Jackson and coach Derek Fisher ideally want to play. I would take Porzingis."
"I'm going to trust the guys in our front office to do their jobs correctly over a mob of arm chair critics."
"It's not just the ability of Towns that excites me, it's his character. Such a charming and genuine person. Very smart too. Seems with him and wiggins we'll have a very good vibe in the team hopefully."
"Its almost as if Towns and Wiggins are the physical manifestation of Minnesota's hope in our sports teams."
"I agree too. Just found this curious."
"Nothing's right I'm torn.... Sorry that song came to mind"
"[deleted]"
"I'm all out of faith. "
"&gt; I lean slightly in Okafor’s favor because I think he has a better chance of being a special, high-impact player. But as I said, my certainty about Towns vs Okafor is low, and yours should be too.
"
"I didn't like this article, and I was the main one arguing against it in the comments. "
"This is going to be a long month"
"ckrown21? I personally think the author gave you a great and convincing answer. I think author's arguments are valid and good. I used to be of the Towns opinion but after the last two weeks, I'll be happy with both decisions."
"Nothing in that article sounds like the wolves are actually torn, they're just selling that spin to get cheap hits. Sounds like a total guess from Chad Ford and the writer. "
"Flip needs to decide who will fit best with Wiggins. Neither of these guys will be the wolves top player."
"I have no idea which one makes more sense...right?

I do think its important to have a player who wants to be here, I have heard rumors of Okafor not wanting to play here, and Towns said it was a blessing, IMO I think that makes a huge difference."
"Nice! "
"&gt; high-impact player.

The only way that this will be the case is if the NBA outlaws defense in the next few years. "
"You go with Towns. It really can be decided just by looking at FT%. Each bring good and not as good. But that FT is huge. 
"
"That's sick, dude!"
"&gt; I personally think the author gave you a great and convincing answer. 

I disagree with this. The author, like most Okafor fans, basically just hand-waved away the need for interior defense and rim protection. They tried to present it as an offense vs defense issue which is ridiculous for multiple reasons: 1) even with all of the injuries, the offense was better than the defense (26 vs 30), 2) without the injuries, the offense was MUCH better than the defense (when Rubio was playing, 8 vs 27), 3) defense is far more important for a Big than offense in the current NBA. "
"Not even official sized? Worst present ever."
"Our team was healthy at the time. How do you know we weren't a 45 win team with Thad and Rubio healthy and Pek for 55 games?"
"This is how I feel."
"[deleted]"
"Do you know what consensus means?  Towns isn't a consensus #1 yet. And Flip said he had Towns and Okafor neck and neck back when everyone else had Okafor #1."
"I'm not an Okafor fan (I know you didn't say it), as I said I'm happy with picking both because I'm 99% sure they both will have great NBA careers. On the other hand, the same arguments apply for Towns fans: 1) Okafor is not 90 on offense and 0 on defense, he already lost 15 pounds for being more mobile/agile. He won't be a T. Chandler but I have hopes he can be correct in this aspect. 2) Even the Pacers needed a George+Stephenson to score, the same applies to the Warriors with Curry. I'm on the board that you need defense to win championships, but you also need to score. An example of what I'm saying is WCS being a lower than 6 pick, because he's supposed to be just defense. If Okafor was just offense he would be next to WCS, while he's not. Also because it seems offense is better valued than defense on the drafts. Summary: Okafor's potential 1st pick is for some reason.

But anyway, what I like about the article is that it says that Okafor does one thing extremely well (attack on the low post), while Towns looks more all-around. This is an interesting thing, imho, and even if again, I usually prefer all-around players, the fact that Okafor can become the core of an offense already featuring Wiggins sounds legit and attractive, because the point of Wiggins having yet to prove that he can lead the offense on a contending team is also legit.

Moreover, and I'm afraid I'm going to be downvoted hard, I don't see (there is not) this supposed-to-be potential in the Wolves right now as for drafting *for fit*. I see we just have Andrew and Rubio. Bazz, Dieng, Payne and nº1 pick Bennett will be, in the best case scenario, just slightly above average players. LaVine's peak is more intriguing for me and may be higher (Jamal Crawford), but I agree with the author in that we cannot consider that we were bad on deffense for picking Towns. If we want to content in 5 years we cannot say ""we were bad last year because Thad Young didn't defend."" We have to ask ""who's gonna be great enough as for contending **and** winning in the upcoming years"". Okafor, a centre with superior low post skills, sounds legit for commanding a contending offense imho. However, there are plenty of ways of winning rings, so I'm not gonna say we have to strictly follow this path because we can win with 3 superstars (10's Lakers), with a whole team (Spurs; Warriors and Hawks this year), with offensive players (OKC years ago), deffensive teams (Pistons, Pacers). PS: Notice I included teams that didn't win rings but were good enough as for being mentioned.

After these past weeks reading and reading and watching videos about the draftees, I think Okafor is in the *different player with unique skills* tier, while Towns, Russell and Mudiay are in the *typical All Stars* tier. And there's nothing bad about this, they are just different kind of players. Maybe Okafor's different but not better. Or maybe this difference makes a difference. We won't know until some years (unless otherwise proven), I just hope whichever our decision the Wolves are in a good position then."
"Wow. Petty. "
"Even though he's NBA ready and a perimeter PF that passes, rebounds, and defends in Euroleague at an MVP level?  I figured if he did that at 22 he'd be top 3. 

Obviously a 20 year old has a higher ceiling, but Bjelica's floor is basically a good rotation player at this point.  If he shoots 37% from 3, rebounds, passes, and is average on defense he's a very solid player.  That's about what he's expected to do."
"Okafor is a sure thing offensively.  I would say Towns is the bigger risk for full bust. "
"Not much people praised this as a good movement. Thad was not the defensive complement Pek needed and didn't seem likely to upgrade much the team. Moreover, realistically, the season before we had a MVP candidate in Love and won 42 games. Without him, the same team and some rookies it was highly unlikely for us to win not even the same games as the previous season. For this reason we were projected as the worst team this season and, we were."
"4) As I tried to point out, Towns was equally as efficient at offense as Okafor last year, and in ways that compliment this Timberwolves team much more. If you look at true shooting percentage (good for comparing bigs), offensive rating (where towns is actually significantly better than Okafor, though this is a flawed stat,) and offensive box plus-minus Towns is right there with Okafor with what he brings on offense. So basically you are throwing out a game changing defensive player and a guy who is comparable to Okafor on offense anyway. Obviously Okafor is a much better low post scorer, but his advantages end there. 

I am in the process of writing a piece for this subreddit and will probably post it Monday comparing advanced stats of the two. Stay tuned!"
"Nice! Can you buy those shirts online somewhere? "
"[deleted]"
"That's because injuries slowed him. You can't predict that in someone like Wally. The bigger issue I have is not trading Wally after seeing he wasn't going to be anything but a scorer, when teams were willing to overpay. But sans injury I'd bet Wally makes another allstar game."
"The author doesn't know. He's not privy to the Wolves reasoning. They make this up every year so they have something to write about."
"&gt; 1) Okafor is not 90 on offense and 0 on defense, he already lost 15 pounds for being more mobile/agile. He won't be a T. Chandler but I have hopes he can be correct in this aspect.

The key word there is ""hopes."" Maybe that lost weight helps Okafor improve greatly on D, maybe it doesn't. Towns, on the other hand, is already good on D AND he's good on O AND he still has plenty of potential to get much better at both. 

&gt;ven the Pacers needed a George+Stephenson to score, the same applies to the Warriors with Curry. I'm on the board that you need defense to win championships, but you also need to score.

Luckily for us, we have guys who can score - Wiggins, LaVine, and Shabazz (and that doesn't even take into account Martin or Rubio setting everyone up with good looks). You're also ignoring that Towns is an excellent offensive prospect in his own right. He was automatic in the post during the tournament. 

&gt;If Okafor was just offense he would be next to WCS, while he's not. 

You're ignoring two very important things: 1) Okafor is younger than WCS and is therefore considered to have more potential, and 2) people overrate offense (at least relative to defense). There's a reason Harden is considered an MVP candidate and Kawhi Leonard isn't despite Kawhi being DPOY. 

&gt;because the point of Wiggins having yet to prove that he can lead the offense on a contending team is also legit.

Okafor hasn't proven that either. And again, you're marginalizing and underrating the importance of defense. 

&gt;but I agree with the author in that we cannot consider that we were bad on deffense for picking Towns.

And we can't consider that we're bad on offense (and we're really not) for picking Okafor, especially since D is FAR more important for Bigs. 

&gt;We have to ask ""who's gonna be great enough as for contending and winning in the upcoming years"". 

And the answer, of course, is the guy that can anchor a defense from the C position (which is ESSENTIAL for a championship; it's no coincidence that the 4 remaining teams in the playoffs all have defenders at the 5 spots) while still providing high level O - Towns!
"
"Kickass!


You must be a good talker ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )"
"Wolfson said that the Wolves see him as a rich man's Robbie Hummel.  I'll let that speak for itself."
"MAMA WE MADE IT"
"Looks like it's [this](http://wolvesproshop.shop.sportstoday.com/Product.aspx?cp=67244_67246&amp;pc=YWCT050) one and [this](http://wolvesproshop.shop.sportstoday.com/Product.aspx?cp=67244_67246&amp;pc=YWCT048) one."
"It's okay, when the Wolves pick Towns he'll just go back and edit the article later."
"Then it's easy then. KAT fits Wiggins and this team a lot better than Okafor. Okafor is basically Al Jefferson, if a team runs their offense through him he can find shooters and cutters and colapse the defense. Towns can spread the floor and is a rim protector that we so desperately need."
"KAT, that's what it means."
"Low post Bigs are like runningbacks in the NFL. They used to be extremely valuable, but rule changes in the last 20 years have marginalized their value. Neither is necessary at all for success currently. "
"Goddammit that's a good analogy.  As much as I love slighting the shuffle pass, I should've used that one..."
"Another interesting note about Okafor's game comes from his [draftexpress profile](http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Jahlil-Okafor-6469/). 52% of Okafor's half court touches were in the post (in his first 17 games). Compare that to Duncan (11.1%), Cousins (13.5%), Gasol (12.5%), and Jefferson (32.5%). Our very own Nikola Pekovic only had 31.4% of his half court touches in the post. 

This goes along perfectly with your point that guys in the NBA just don't play in the post. Even the best post guys get the majority of their touches out of the post. For Okafor to be a success in the current NBA, he'll have to adjust his game in the same way that Duncan did - by becoming a more of a face-up and pick-and-roll player. This would mean that his biggest strength, the thing that has him in the discussion for number 1, really wouldn't be used much. "
"You concisely vocalized all of my concerns with Okafor. I would much rather have Mr. Towns. The free throw shooting is especially concerning to me. "
"Agree. I'd like to see a coach grow with our team (a college coach, e.g.) or a veteran presence to teach all the youngsters the winning way since now.

We should already have a coach for the draft pick, but..."
"All I know is 2-3 of those guys are sitting out. Still a big list though "
"I read that Brooks might sit out next year and collect his checks, and I read today that Thibodeau might go that route. 

New Orleans is the most attractive position and they're talking to candidates while Chicago deliberates on Thibodeau.  If Thibodeau misses out on the NOR job then we're the next most attractive destination.  I think we've surpassed Orlando at this point. "
"What a very well spoken guy. "
"As a heart-broken Sonics fan, this post made me miss the NBA even more. I miss breaking down draft picks. Back when it was Portland #1 and Seattle #2 and people were arguing between Greg Oden vs Kevin Durant. Everyone in Seattle wanted Durant for a multitude of reasons. When Portland took Oden, it was like winning the lottery."
"Between how many of those coaches are clear upgrades and those who'd actually entertain the idea you could probably cut 3/4s of the list. "
"I believe Dallas would at least look at him with #21 otherwise the Spurs at #26."
"[deleted]"
"""Clear upgrades"" is a debatable issue and each individual's actual interest in the job is relatively unclear.  The point is that there are quality names out there.  Eliminate 3/4 of the list, I don't care.  The argument still stands.  Fred Hoiberg is on it, he's gettable.  And I've already argued that I think the job is attractive enough for a guy like him.  We've been clamoring for him for years. Hire Fred Hoiberg.  Interview Fred Hoiberg.  Do something.  The time with him is now.  Chicago will get him if we don't. "
"I think he wants to establish him self as the creator of this team. Like in a few years down the road if the wolves become a top team, he wanrd to be remembered as rhe guy who brought the team together."
"It doesn't matter if the Wolves interview Hoiberg he's not going to be dumb enough to take the job without hearing from the Bulls.  "
"I wonder how much who we take in the draft will affect who would want to coach here"
"ngl I envy the Celtics for luring Brad Stevens, he's looking to be a franchise coach. I really want Flip to find someone like him, young and able to grow with the team. Not some coach jumping teams every couple of years like a lot on that list."
"You're anti Okafor? Huh,  you've been hiding it well in the few articles you've written about taking anyone but him.  "
"What if the Bulls interview Hoiberg and Gentry and decide to go with Gentry?  Then his momentum is headed toward the NBA and away from Iowa St.  NOLA doesn't seem interested in him.  We're second in line.  We have a chance at him.  You have to try.  No excuses.  We tried for Joerger last year and had very little chance at him.  What has changed since then?  We still need a coach. "
"that whole thing about Okafor was kinda BS. He said that he didn't know if he should go first overall BEFORE the lottery because he was being humble."
"That would be good.  The list is minor point in my argument that there are names out there.  And there are *always* young coaches out there willing to take a risk on.  That makes Flip's ""waiting for the right guy"" stance ring even more hollow. "
"Gonna go through your list.  I know you qualified that you don't necessarily think we *should* hire some of these guys, but there are a few that I just don't like at all and wouldn't have even bothered including.

&gt;Mike Malone

I really like Malone.  I have no idea why Sacto fired him.  Wolfson said a week or two ago that he's being courted by the Nuggets but he's still holding out for an offer from the Wolves.

&gt; Fred Hoiberg (currently circling Chicago)

My personal preference, but who knows what's going to happen.  Hopefully his connections here give us an advantage if he decides to finally make the jump.

&gt;Sam Cassell (Flip's boy, blocked by Doc in Clipper Land)

I could see him as a good coach, though I'm not sure how high up on my list he'd be.

&gt; Tom Thibodeau (likely to be fired)

I'm kind of indifferent on Thibs.  He's a really good coach but he has some tendencies that make me worry.

&gt; Scott Skiles

No actual opinion.

&gt; Scott Brooks

Fuuuuuck no.  I think OKC won despite him, not because of him.  He'd be a good assistant though.

&gt; Alvin Gentry

Also no opinion.

&gt; Tom Izzo (Flip's boy, but would he leave NCAA?)

I'm not sure he'd see the Wolves job as an upgrade, honestly.

&gt; Monty Williams

Another coach that I was surprised got fired.  I'd definitely welcome him here.

&gt; Mike Woodson

C'mon, son!

&gt; Mike D'Antoni

"It ain't right what they did to your town.  As one from the city where the North Stars came from (NORM SUCKS!) I feel your pain."
"I'm not saying don't interview him, I'm saying being first doesn't matter. Your thought that it needs to be done before Thibs is traded/fired is pointless cause Hoiberg is going to wait on the Bulls.  

The ""time with him"" isn't now.  Like you said in your reply, it's only after the possibility Chicago passes on him.  "
"To me the list boils down to Malone and Hoiberg.  The rest are either not all that likely to be interested in the job or are unattractive hires to me personally.  ~~Cassell~~ Edit: Billups is a wildcard though.  But I do think that the position is attractive enough a lot of these big names would be dumb and short-sighted not to consider the position.  It's a Coach of the Year situation waiting to happen for any great coach. "

"Another interesting note:

Towns scored 0.92 PPP on ""the block."" [3:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq90u5OG-bY)

Okafor scored 0.933 PPP on ""post possessions."" [4:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNgjYxttRL0)

Okafor had far larger sample size, and there's the question about defensive attention and role between the two to take into account, but they're really not that far off in terms of effectiveness when trying to score in the post."
"By ""now"" I meant this offseason.  Flip isn't in coaching search mode at all right now.  If he was, he'd be talking to people and we'd be seeing some rumors/news.   He outright said at his end of year press conference that he's going to remain HC.  Chances are pretty decent that Hoiberg will move to the NBA this offseason.  If so, it looks like we're going to miss out on him, doesn't it?

Malone is looking at the Nuggets, but would probably prefer the situation here.  Other teams are looking and doing their due dilligence while we do nothing, at the risk of actual good coaches passing us by.  Coaches that Flip actually LIKES.  He brought in Malone. "
"I am...  I mean, I did write that one where it's a take on both Okafor and WCS.

I've largely been holding formation and circling for the past month.  I plan on writing about Towns, Okafor, Russell, Hezonja, Jones, and some other guys before the draft.  It usually takes me about 2-3 days between research and final edits to crank one out, so I think I'll be able to hit all of them.  I was largely idling because Eric at Canis pointed out that before the lottery, there's not much of a reason to be writing about prospects, being that our position dictates who will be in discussion.

With the other pieces, I didn't see any reason to wait.

But yeah, I'm considerably anti-Okafor.  It actually bums me out considerably that the low post game is so inefficient in the NBA these days.  I spent so, so much time on my post game, and I still help out high school recruits who need some help.  When I write against Okafor, it's an indictment against my central identity."
"Flip is still coaching because he's his own boss and is ~3 seasons away from having a team that could become a legit contender. He's not going anywhere, anytime soon."
"Agreed on all points."
"The list boils down to Malone and Holberg.  Everybody else is just there to stack the deck.  Might as well add Kurt Rambis while we're at it...

Flip's been looking for a coach.  I'd so much rather him wait for the perfect one instead of hiring another retread who couldn't cut it in the league.  You guys have forgotten awfully quickly how intensely he courted David Joerger and the offer he made to Chauncey Billups.  He's looking for a coach, and there's no reason to take the development of Wiggins and Co. out of his hands.

This subreddit has gotten so fickle and reactionary.  We don't shoot 3's this season, and everybody loses their goddamn minds.  We might have the next Kobe on our hands, and people are screaming that we should be shaping him into Wesley Matthews.  The 3-pointer is the easiest thing to add, but you can't unlearn bad chucking habits.  Antoine Walker is a classic example of somebody who was told to chuck too early.

Seriously people.  Calm down.  Flip's not a moron, he's a super smart guy who has made a career out of basketball.  If any of you had a 1 on 1 conversation with him about basketball, his overall knowledge of the game would blow you away.

Put away the pitchforks and rope.  Nobody's getting tarred and feathered today."
"You know, if flip stats for one more year (Purely for building up the players skills and getting a higher draft pick) so we can dominate next year, I won't be mad."
"D'Antoni would be a freaking great coach for our team. Rubio, Wiggins, Shabazz, LaVine (and also Towns) are tailor made for his system.

I hate reddit sometimes. D'Antoni gets put in a stupid bad position in LA with a fuckload of injuries and a team with worse chemistry issues than the Sprewell Warriors and people decide he can't coach. The dude competed for championships every year with a fucking six man team (granted three of those six guys were Nash, Amar'e and Shawn Marion) then replicated that success in New York without the talent.

**Fuck, I'd rather have D'Antoni than literally everyone on the guys list other than Izzo.**

***Edit: 100% serious question to D'Antoni haters of reddit - did you start watching hoops within the last 5 years?***"
"Pointless comparison. That's like saying, ""hey, Pablo Prigioni averaged more points as a PnR ball handler than Lebron this year.""

Okafor was a go-to guy facing consistent double teams and being asked to create shots from the post during crunch time every single game. Towns had what, 35 post ups that he finished with a shot or foul last year (just guessing).

&gt;they're really not that far off in terms of effectiveness when trying to score in the post.

I'm in the Towns bandwagon but this is just a ridiculous thing to say."
"At least we aren't torn between Porzingis.

"
"&gt; The list boils down to Malone and Holberg. Everybody else is just there to stack the deck. Might as well add Kurt Rambis while we're at it...

The list is there to combat Flip's assertion that he needs to remain Head Coach because the right guy isn't out there.   There are plenty of guys out there that are a clear upgrade to Flip Saunders.

&gt; Flip's been looking for a coach.

Nah, Flip WAS looking for a coach.  At this exact time last year Dave Joerger was already declining our offer.  This year we're not doing anything.  Nothing that I've seen.

&gt; there's no reason to take the development of Wiggins and Co. out of his hands.

Yes there is.  To install a coach who can teach the kids winning basketball.  Your latest post analyzes how post-offense is becoming obsolete in the NBA.  Meanwhile our Head Coach is the same guy who is perhaps the only GM in the League who would strongly consider drafting Jahlil Okafor over Towns.  And this is who we want to go forward with?  Another 82 games of Wiggins posting up in isolation at the expense of teaching him and the others a modern, efficient NBA offense? 

&gt; This subreddit has gotten so fickle and reactionary. We don't shoot 3's this season, and everybody loses their goddamn minds.

You're going to group my post in with a bunch of other stuff I never hinted at?  

Flip Saunders has admitted that we should hire a new coach.  Glen Taylor says he WANTS a new coach.  What is fickle about A FAN wanting a new coach?  I'm a single person, not the entire sub.  Each post you read isn't the same person changing their opinion, we're all separate people.  It's been 300 some days since we went at Joerger.  I want some action, and that's not reactionary. 

&gt; Seriously people. Calm down. Flip's not a moron, he's a super smart guy who has made a career out of basketball. If any of you had a 1 on 1 conversation with him about basketball, his overall knowledge of the game would blow you away.

I'm calm.  I never said Flip wasn't smart.  I have no problem with him remaining POBO.  I've put forth arguments about why I think Flip should not be our head coach, in addition to grievances about him not engaging in an active search of coaching candidates.  His qualifications or knowledge relative my own have nothing to do with my reasons for not wanting him to be coach any longer. Reason knows no qualifications.  I don't want to debate Flip Saunders, I just want him not to be Coach. 

&gt; Put away the pitchforks and rope. Nobody's getting tarred and feathered today.

They were never out. "

"If Okafor is so special and dominant scoring on the low post I don't agree with your argument of him hurting the offense. It may be the case that Okafor becomes the next Carmelo Anthony: great scorer but don't win, but it shouldn't be because centres that cannot shot are ineffective because of the spacing. Howard, Bogut, Mozgov or DeAndre are just examples of how teams can effectively attack with non-shooting centres and with slashers like Harden, Brewer or James in their teams. They have shooters (see Howard's teams). That the TWolves don't have shooters is not an Okafor problem and the solution won't be neither to draft Towns.

PS: Other noticeable example are the Grizzlies or even the Spurs. Marc, Randolph or Duncan don't shoot 3s, even if they do have midrange shoot, and yet their teams win. As I said somewhere else on Reddit, you can win with different strategies, and having a low post beast with Wiggins and more competent players seems one for me.

PS: I think there's bust possibilities with both and dominating possibilities with both, so I'm ok with who we draft. I've said this already several times, so Imma focus on my exams and forget about the draft until June =D"
"What, and you expect those guys to be willing to sign a one year deal with the knowledge that they'll be shipped out the moment an upgrade comes along?  The coach we sign should be with us for the long haul.

""Nothing that I've seen.""  Did you heard about the Chauncey Billups talks while they were happening too..?  Running an NBA team isn't a transparent operation.  Just because we're not hearing about it doesn't mean it's not happening.

I have a few sources close to the situation that I've been speaking about it with.  There's a ton of stuff going on that the media is only hypothesizing.  90% of the stuff people are saying about the situation is made up, but some of the things they're saying is correct.  This is a delicate procedure.  Besides, it would be stupid not to preform due diligence in this situation.  I don't like Okafor, but this is a make or break draft.  If something happens with Towns, we don't wanna piss off the guy who we're going to take now because we asserted to early who our favorite was.  Players care a ton about stuff like that.  Flip's just playing his hand close to the chest and the media is going nuts with it.  Barring an escalation of the situation, we're going to be taking Towns, don't kid yourself into thinking we're inept.

Yes, I am.  A culture of Flip bashing has emerged in this subreddit.  I don't know what views you endorse on every matter, but this definitely falls under the genre of needless Flip-bashing when the answer is insanely rational.  Flip is doing almost the exact opposite of everything the Pelicans have done over the past 3 years.  He's playing the long-game, and it seems like there's a sizable group of people on here who can't forecast and want something tangible, no matter the short sighted cost.  This is yet another post wanting action without regards as to the quality of the action.

A new coach that is worth having is going to emerge at some point.  You never know where the next Brad Stevens will come from.  I so no reason to hire known quantity when we know that they're awful.  Everybody wants Holberg, and only the Nuggets seem to want Malone badly a season after he was let go.  There's a reason why these guys are open."
"Something something lying naked on the floor."
"I'd love to see Hoiberg or Cassell for us"
"I agree with doogie in that flip is waiting another year for hoiberg.  Hoiberg wants to coach in the NBA and his family wants to be in the state of minnesota, but he just had open heart surgery and signed a contract with ISU so he will just wait it out."
"Neither is necessary for success, sure, but definitely correlated with success. Look at the recent NBA champions.  Tim Duncan Spurs, Shaq and Wade Heat, Dirk and the Mavericks, Kobe and Pau. Only Detroit and Miami have won titles this decade without using a large number of post ups and having a guy who draws double teams there (Lebron draws doubles but doesn't have the volume). Dirk is more of a mid post player like LMA so that might not be the best example, but you get the point. You can win titles without a dominate post up guy, but having one of those guys is a good indicator of success. Of the 10 best post up guys this decade, at least half have won titles.
"
"I want two coaches for this team, Alvin Gentry or I think a great long term hire to get this team into a dynasty mode with our young team is Tyronn Lue."
"The possibility that he might be in secret talks with his own pet prospects doesn't satisfy me personally.  Other teams are doing their due dilligence on the top coaching candidates, but Flip talks to his own guys no one else is interested in, in secret?  Is he too much of a maverick for a formal coaching search?  Or is he just not doing much of anything?  I think it's the latter.

But because I want Flip to hire a new coach (like he said he was going to do), I fall under some exaggerated umbrella of ""let's turn Wiggins into Wes Matthews""?  What?  I've never even heard that claim before, so I'm assuming it's your own ridiculous counter-strawman to the sensible argument that Wiggins should be operating in an offense that turns more of his long twos into threes.  Flip seems to believe that the FG% increase from shooting a few feet in front of the three point line is worth more than the value of the extra point you get from stepping outside of it.  His offense supports that this is his belief.  His playsets don't generate open threes while the rest of the league is trending towards it, to their gain and our detriment.  

Any and all Flip bashing is not needless.  Criticism is warranted, especially when it's reasonable.  I don't care if you think my opposition to HC Flip Saunders is fickle, reactionary, short-sighted, or whatever other terms you've used to dismiss my arguments.  I think Flip is a bad Head Coach.  I've put forth reasons why.  My reasons aren't hysterical.  I want a better Coach, and Flip will have had two offseasons to get one.  He's off to a slow (arguably non-existent) start so far.  If he's carrying out some secret underground trick where he's gonna pull a rabbit out of his hat and make some surprise ideal coaching hire that none of us foresaw, I'll eat my crow.  Until then, I'm going to remain disappointed at the lack of a formal coaching search.  The kind most respectable organizations engage in. "

"Adding more context to my point, the ten best post up guys in my opinion are: 

1. Shaq

2. Duncan

3. Pau

4. Kobe

5. Dirk

6. Big Al

7. LMA

8. Bynum

9. Marc

10. Chauncey Billups

Lots of **success** in that group.
"
"First, I specified low post Big for a reason. 

Second, 

Duncan - 11.1% of his touches in the half court this year were in the low post. He's become much more of a face up and pick-and-roll playerin the last decade (similar to Towns).

Dirk - Mid-post and face-up, not low post

Kobe - See Dirk

Pau - See Duncan

Shaq - The only one that actually spent significant time in the low post, and he was a unique talent.

Of all the guys that you listed, Towns fits the mold better than Okafor. "
"I really don't get all the hate for having Flip as coach.  He's arguably the second-most qualified coach we've ever gotten to come work in this podunk northern town, and I believe he still has the winningest record of any coach we've ever had (though McHale may have overtaken him as coach of the Rockets by now, I haven't checked the exact numbers.)

He's a great developer of young talent (Chauncey Billups, John Wall, etc.) and a pretty good X's and O's guy.  The ""old fashioned offense that hates 3-point shooting"" critique is a little unfair, simply because the Wolves had a lot of guys recently who should NEVER have the ""green light"" to chuck up threes (like Corey Brewer, for one glaring example.)

Bottom line is:  He's a pretty good coach, and I'm cool with him running the show until somebody with *at least* Adelman's level of credentials expresses interest in the job."
"Hoiberg has never coached an NBA game.  Or even an A-list college team.  Nobody would have such a hard-on for him if he wasn't regarded as a ""one of us"" local boy. "
"&gt;Pointless comparison. That's like saying, ""hey, Pablo Prigioni averaged more points as a PnR ball handler than Lebron this year.""

No, it would be like saying, ""Hey, Brandon Knight averaged about the same amount of POINTS PER POSSESSION (THIS IS IMPORTANT!) (0.82) as LeBron (0.82)."" 

&gt;Towns had what, 35 post ups that he finished with a shot or foul last year (just guessing).

Talking about saying ridiculous things. Actually do some research into how each player was used and then come back. 

Edit:

Also, if you would have bothered to actually watch the link that I included next to that stat, you would have seen that post ups were 42.7% of Towns' offense this year. "
"3/4 = 75%
11 names on that list.
11 - 75% = 2.75

So you're saying there are 2 or 3 coaches on that list who are clear upgrades from Flip and who want the job? I rather think the point stands."
"&gt; Okafor’s the better prospect.  He has enormous hands (which helps his ball handling and playmaking) which might play a factor in his poor shooting.


No, no, no, no, no.  Please stop perpetuating this myth.  As a big man with big hands, I can personally vouch that being tall and having big hands is helpful in shooting, and anyone who says otherwise is simply making excuses (Shaq).  Towns has big hands.  Yao had enormous hands.  Free throw shooting is nothing more than  practice and muscle memory.  "
"&gt; Sam Cassell (Flip's boy, blocked by Doc in Clipper Land)

You realize that Flip's admitted inability to control Sam Cassell's head-case nonsense was most of the reason why the Wolves fired him the first time around right?  I seriously doubt Flip the executive wants anything to do with bringing in Cassell as a head coach or even head towel boy."
"&gt; The ""old fashioned offense that hates 3-point shooting"" critique is a little unfair, simply because the Wolves had a lot of guys recently who should NEVER have the ""green light"" to chuck up threes (like Corey Brewer, for one glaring example.)

It's not unfair, Flip's offenses consistently rank towards the bottom of the league in 3PA, not just this current iteration of the Wolves.  BTW, this is a Wolves team he constructed, largely.  The ""we don't have guys who can shoot threes"" is a weak apology when Flip is the one who signed Corey Brewer in the first place.  If Flip understood the value of the 3 pointer, he probably wouldn't have constructed a roster with a deficiency in 3 point shooters. "
"Yes that's my mistake, I meant Chauncey Billups.  I mixed up my former Timberwolf pullup jumper specialist PG's.  Every time I've said Cassell, I meant Billups.  Because Flip went after him last offseason.  There's probably no interest at all in Cassell.  Billups is the ""wildcard.""  I have no idea why he turned down the job last year.  Maybe it would be more attractive to him with our currently impressive collection of assets. "
"He's regarded as a Head Coaching prospect across most of the NBA.  Chicago is interested.  He has legit value on the market, homerism isn't really at play here. "
"totally agree. the entire premise is based on pure eye-testy ""he looked more dominant"" type assertions which is ridiculous because he won't be going up against 6'9"" centers in the post in the NBA"
"Okay, Billups is a less crazy suggestion.

He may have turned the job down last year for the same reason almost everybody else did:  Roster uncertainty.

Now that people have a better sense of what the Wolves will be over the next two or three years, there may be good coaches interested... Or maybe Flip needs to build them into a legitimate winning team before it's really considered all that attractive of a job.  The Wolves have been horribly dysfunctional for a very, very long time after all.

Also, for all we know, Flip might not be the sort of executive coaches like to work for.  All we know is that Adelman seemed more or less okay with him and his son is still there as an assistant."
"Wolfson also said Flip was ridiculously high on Hummel. And since Hummel defends, rebounds, and shoots .343 from 3 for his career it's not the worst comparison. Imagine if Hummel was a better ball handler, passer, shooter, and had better court vision/BBIQ. That's a solid NBA player. "
"I guess I'm higher than the consensus on him. I thought he'd be a half-tier below Mirotic this year but people seem to think less of him than me."
"Thanks for the feedback guys."
"He's continued to be, shall we say, a point of contention among the frequent commenters on the site. That's a good chunk of where the piece was targeted. (full disclosure: I wrote it)"
"&gt; This has never been something that has never worked, ever

Except in seeing that Kevin Love was worth trading away O.J. Mayo for.  Also for seeing that we should turn down Boston's bundle of picks for Love because we could get more for him.  Also for seeing that trading down to get Bazz and Dieng rather than taking Burke was the way to go.  Also for drafting LaVine when more proven players were still on the board.

But apart from that, *what have the Romans ever done for us!?!?!?*"
"I kind of feel like the ball-handling is almost a bonus. I want to see his off-ball movement continue to improve, which will be greatly helped by time with an actual living, breathing point guard. That feels like the greatest way to amplify his existing gifts."
"Personally, I think Flip isn't looking for *a* coach who is better than him, I think he's looking for *the* coach who can both develop our young roster into a championship contender, and still go deep in the playoffs. In the mean time, Flip is his own placeholder who can get replaced in a day if the right candidate steps forward. That might be the best option right now."
"As someone who watched those Suns teams and is excluding the laker years and lives in NYC, I don't want D'antonio. 

He rides his stars into injuries literally everywhere he goes. 

Look to Nash, Stat, Kobe, &amp; Melo. 

I love his pace of play for our team -- I think it'd be phenomenal but I don't want our players playing D'antonio type minutes. "
"I think he wants to make sure the right guys get the right minutes whereas another coach may be trying to win now. "
"Flip is still coaching because he loves coaching. He was never going to get someone else to coach this team, he barely looked last year. He isn't looking now, this is his team he is grand czar Taylor may want someone else to coach the team but he ran out of all control when he gave Flip the President title and sold a portion of the team to him. Flip isn't giving up the coaching job when the team gets good either, he's going to run it until the wheels fall off. "
"Well, the larger sample size (i think it's significantly larger) matters a lot. Towns didn't have to develop many counters and Okafor has more counters than almost anybody else coming out of college ever. 

Towns is definitely nice and reliable doing the simple hooks though."
"Yeah, i like D'Antoni and recognize that he's accomplished a lot in his coaching career with both very talented and little talented groups. I definitely want him to coach in the NBA, just not my team."
"Don't forget the Lakers!"
"He is not speaking about what worked in the NBA 10 years ago, rather about what works now and will likely work in the future. I do not know what success you think these players have had recently, beyond Duncan of course. Marc Gasol's team has actively attempted to move away from posting up for the past 3 years, LMA was almost swept out of consecutive playoffs, Dirk won 4 years ago and hardly any of that involved posting up. "
"I think the author is valid in raising the question of whether Wiggins will become a primary or secondary option on offense and it bears repeating that no one outside of Martin can hit jump shots with any consistency on the current roster. But neglecting to highlight the wide gap between the two players defensively sort of registers his whole point void. "
"I'm not making any kind of point about Towns or Okafor here, or at least I'm not intending too. As I've said many times, I think I prefer Towns.

I'm arguing against the idea that post skills are useless / don't contribute to success. They aren't and they do."
"Very high floor but his floor is also probably close to his ceiling. You're drafting a solid rotation player when most teams are picking for potential."

"looks slightly bigger too"
"I don't think this kid has even reached his floor yet. He's just like Wiggins in the fact that he knows he can be great. If these guys continue to push each other there's no telling what this team can become. I cant put into words how excited I am."
"... seriously?

That would be an understandable thing to think a year ago at this time, before Flip acted like our team was going to compete for the playoffs and traded a first round pick for a 1-year rental of Thad Young.


Flip did the exact thing you're saying he doesn't want another coach to do. The only reason our young guys got minutes to develop was because our roster got ravaged by injuries. "
"Why not let the players ""build up skills"" while playing for and learning from  their long-term coach?"
"Yeah, players never develop/improve on their weaknesses from college"
"&gt; I believe he still has the winningest record of any coach we've ever had 

Really!? He's even better than Rambis?

Another way of wording this accolade is ""Flip was coach when KG was playing here"""
"So basically he's going to win the next 5 dunk contests."
"So you think he can get even worse?  

His ceiling is super high, but we all got a look at his floor during the season.  I think it's all up from there "
"If he can get even higher elevation on his jumpers its going to be pretty damn hard to defend him. "
"Not true. He completely turned around a disastrous team and has the highest winning percentage in Iowa State's history.

He's a very hot coaching candidate."

"Just to put this in perspective, the record highest for an NBA player is 46 (although unofficial sources have a few higher). Zach is two inches short."
"Ya I probably worded that poorly. He had a decent year this year but I think what he did this year is far below what even an average year is going to be like for him. It made sense in my head. But yes, Zach's ceiling is ridiculously high. Probably around Russell Westbrook with how he attacks but I think he's got a sweeter stoke than Russell. The kid is a baller."
"Zing!"
"Yeah, that's a weird thing to say."
"He must have just gotten ceiling and floor mixed up?  Lol who knows. "
"wolves are gonna be fucking serious in a couple of years"
"Flip did find one. Jorger stayed in Memphis instead."
"I disagree. Is Mirotic a solid rotational player?  Korver?  Bjelica is not a rotational bench player at best.  He started as a PG in a forwards body, now he defends and rebounds the PF position well in Europe (which usually translates). If he shoots close to 40% from 3 he's a $10 mil a year player.  He's obviously a good passer and ball handler.

His worst case scenario is a rich man's Hummel with passing and handles. His best case is an all star perimeter PF that rebounds and defends better than average.

JMHO"
"All of those guys are over 7 ft as well.  Okafor is too small to play a low lost center at 6'11 and dominate.  It just won't work in the NBA."
"Do you remember how good Orlando was with Howard and 4 shooters?  And what is Duncan again?  It's still clearly possible to build a contender around a low post monster.

Obviously Towns is the better fit if Shabazz and Wiggins are our future starters (LaVine &lt; Shabazz IMHO).  But I disagree that a dominant post scorer isn't a great asset on a championship contender. "
"Except that he's a better low post scorer AND passer than Jefferson and Pekovic. He looks like he'll be the best low post offensive player in the NBA.  The single best, that's how good he looks already."
"Fuck me"
"Towns had a significantly higher AST% than Okafor. Just saying. And that's with Okafor getting tons more opportunities to rack up assists because he had the ball much more."
"[deleted]"
"I feel like he should be working on his jumpshot."
"Lol, working on your main strength may not be quite as useful as improving actual basketball skills. "
"Let's see how he does against NBA bigs before giving him the title of best low post offensive player. "
"They don't have to be mutually exclusive."
"&gt; Another way of wording this accolade is ""Flip was coach when KG was playing here""

Sure, and you could likewise say ""Jackson was the Bulls coach when Jordan was there, and the Lakers coach when Kobe was in his prime.""  

He took over the team midway through KG's second year and oversaw his development from pretty much the beginning, but no credit at all for helping to groom an all-time hall of fame player, huh?  Okay whatever."
"We shall see bud!"
"They were gone more than a decade before I was born.  Also, NBA basketball was far less of a big deal in those days."
"If he can jump well enough, he won't need to shoot, he's going for the space jam strategy."
"Flip is crap, he was mediocre back in the day and he's even worse now. Chauncey and Wall are terrible examples of players Flip developed because they got better after Flip wasn't their coach anymore. The old fashioned offense that hates 3-point shooting critique is absolutely fair because no matter his personnel throughout his entire coaching history his teams have usually ranked in the bottom of 3 pointers.  

 Get this Flip's coaching makes his players worse at shooting from 3. Brewer, Mo, and Thad Young were all on the Wolves this season and subsequently moved to different teams by the end and all 3 of them saw a huge jump in 3 point attempt rate. All 3 saw a boost in their overall efficiency and TS%. Brewer went from a garbage shooter 3 point shooter under Flip to finishing around his career average, and Thad shot almost 10% better than under Flip.   

Flip is bad. At this point actively hurts the team on offense by not running plays for 3s or not encouraging the team as a whole to take more. His one saving grace back in the day was that he could run a decent offense in a league that hadn't yet found the importance of the 3 ball yet, but now he's a dinosaur in that regard. Combine that with his consistency to never coaching up a defense better than it's parts and any one of those candidates in the OP would be a far greater coach than what Flip is in today's NBA. "
"&gt; I'm arguing against the idea that post skills are useless / don't contribute to success. 

Then you're arguing against something that I'm not arguing for. 

I never said that they don't contribute to success. I said that their value has been marginalized and that they're not NECESSARY for success. You can succeed without a low post Big. If anything, your examples proved my point. "
"That only works if your arm is 5 meters long."
"&gt; Well, the larger sample size (i think it's significantly larger) matters a lot. 

The videos I linked say that Okafor had 328 post possessions, which was 1st in CBB. Towns had 42.7% of his possessions in the post. Draftexpress also says that he had 8.4 possessions per game. 8.4 x 39 x 0.427 = 140 possessions. 

So, Towns had 140 possessions in the post and Okafor had 328 possessions in the post. Okafor's sample is obviously significantly bigger, but I'd still say that Towns' sample is big enough to come to some conclusions. 

&gt;Towns didn't have to develop many counters and Okafor has more counters than almost anybody else coming out of college ever.

My point is, if all those extra counters didn't allow Okafor to score any more points per possession in the post, do they really matter? Are they just aesthetic fluff?

Obviously there's a good argument that those extra moves will help Okafor translate his post game to the NBA, where the defenders are bigger, faster, stronger, and more talented, better, but how much will it help Okafor translate his post game? It clearly didn't make a huge difference going from High School to College. "
"They figured us out"
"That's a pretty play"
"Towns seems like the obvious choice of the new type of big, one that can shoot. "
"Lets not say things like that unless you're going to stop making predictions about how prospects will play in the NBA as well. No one likes a judgmental know it all hypocrite. You are that person way too often. "
"lol. Just saying Okafor did well against centers that were like 6 foot 9. Against real 7 footers he didn't do so well, like in the tournament vs Utah."
"Observations: 

Chase and Robbie set good screens for wing players. Both were consistently hitting there.

Chase needs to either cut to the three point line or to the Kevin Martin spot. Those 21 foot two pointers are ridiculous.

Andrew should drive off the catch every single time they run that play for him."
"All of the Kevin Martin mid-range J's you could ever want in one video.  

"
"Work on defense and strength you fucking idiot"
"&gt;&gt; Another way of wording this accolade is ""Flip was coach when KG was playing here""

&gt;no credit at all for helping to groom an all-time hall of fame player, huh?  Okay whatever.

I'll give him the same amount of credit as everyone here gives Scott Brooks for grooming KD, Russ, Harden, and Ibaka. Or the same amount of credit as you give Jordan's coach for him becoming the GOAT.

I don't think head coaches do much for development of players. Greats will be great, and they are very easy for head coaches to utilize.

If any coaches deserve credit for developing players, I would say it's the five assistant coaches more than the one head coach. "
"He is"
"He is, you fucking idiot."
"Who had 46?"
"Idk about the NBA draft being more important, have you seen the NHL draft this year? MCEICHEL HYPE."
"I'll believe it when I see it. There's a reason he's so great at dunk contests and not so great at NBA basketball. We've heard the stories about how much time he spends practicing things that aren't actually useful in games. How is this any different?"
"Because this looks to be an ad. Lavine seems to be bulking up, which he needs to. He will be in the gym this entire summer, dude is a die hard. He is also like 19. "
"Dude wants to go to the moon"
"Jordan had huge hands."
"I have you tagged now as ""Really wants to give me a tag."""
"This is the worst article I have read yet.  Okafor is too small, and his game won't work in the NBA.  A low post offense is not what any of the teams are doing.  They shoot three pointers.   I saw an article yesterday that said even teams like San antonio only go through a low post 10 percent of the time.  No one plays back to the basket low post big man plays anymore.  6'11 christian laetner type players don't do well in the NBA because every team has two guys that size on the floor.  In college okafor was going against teams whose tallest player was 6'9.  

Draft towns.. He has a game that works in today's NBA."
"Has to be Towns. Just a way better fit in today's NBA. "
"If you can jump over them, shooting becomes easy! No problem haha"
"We shall see, i'll think of something creative sooner or later!"
"You say that like he isn't working on it.  I'm sure he is...he has to know how good he can be if he minimizes his mistakes, so I think he's going to work on everything and anything he can.

I absolutely love watching the kid play, so I hope he reaches his ceiling and stays there.  He's the Geno smith of basketball right now.  Low lows and high highs.  Get rid of or at least minimize those lows, and get those highs a little higher and holy shit "
"Exactly, so do Durant and Dirk, but they're not complaining.  It's just a stupid myth perpetuated mainly by Shaq to absolve himself of blame. "
"for reference his vert was ""only"" 41.5"" at the draft combine a little over a year ago."
"Lol that was hilarious, the thirst is real. "
"Gerald Green?"
"The great D.J. Stephens in 2013, apparently. (Edit: He did it at a workout with the Nets, so I'm not sure if it counts as official). 

Vince Carter had a 43"" vertical at the combine, and I don't think Gerald Green ever had an official measurement. "
"&gt;My point is, if all those extra counters didn't allow Okafor to score any more points per possession in the post, do they really matter? Are they just aesthetic fluff?

They allow him to draw double teams as well as score against locked down defense in the crunch. It might not amount to significantly more scoring, but it's more valuable scoring, because he can create that at any time.

&gt;The videos I linked say that Okafor had 328 post possessions, which was 1st in CBB. Towns had 42.7% of his possessions in the post. Draftexpress also says that he had 8.4 possessions per game. 8.4 x 39 x 0.427 = 140 possessions.

This doesn't mean exactly what you think it does. Okafor had double the amount of post possessions, but attempted more than double the amount of shots from the post. A post - kick - repost or just a post - kick is counted as a touch in these numbers. To make an apples to apples comparison you need to count only the possessions from which they attempted a shot or got fouled.

For example the video you linked shows Towns attempted 28 left hooks and 9 right hooks last season, with the hook being basically his only move. Let's be really generous and double the number to say he attempted an equal number of those and got fouled so they don't count as field goal attempts. That's around 70 possessions *finished*, meaning he tried to score and didn't just catch in the post and then pass it back out."
"I would definitely also appreciate this. "
"Another interesting stat from the videos you posted: Jah had more and-1s out of the post than KAT had made field goals."
"I don't think it's a good analogy; NFL offense has evolved to a point where you can plug-in just about any mediocre RB to a good offense and get by, but plugging a mediocre Big into an otherwise good NBA lineup could actually hinder your team. 

Also, the Brow might be an exception, but he has certainly changed his team from struggling a playoff contender. "
"Ha, I agree overall regarding Bigs and RBs having marginalized value, but just posted the [exact opposite reaction to the analogy](http://www.reddit.com/r/timberwolves/comments/370g8l/guys_were_losing_the_scope_of_how_unimportant/crjn046), then saw your response."
"I'm not talking about Bigs in general. The analogy refers ONLY to low-post Bigs. DeAndre Jordan, for example, couldn't be called anything but bad in the low-post, but he's still the starting C on a contender. "
"Howard is an athletic freak. Okafor is not.

Duncan is one of the best defenders at his position of all time. Okafor is not.

Give me the name of the last superstar center who was a dominant post scorer, average defender, and average athlete."
"Flip's an above average GM, but he's a shitty coach, those long 2s are awful. I don't understand why we run plays to get the worst shot in basketball. Take a step back and 50% more points on each of those shots."
"Okafor is far from a sure thing offensively.

He dominated 6 foot 9 centers in college, and the two games he was up against NBA sized big men he struggled. Guys like Deandre, Marc Gasol, Lopez, and Boogie are going to eat him alive because despite his size, he's a very average athlete.

Without the ability to score outside of the post, he clogs the lane and makes it tougher for slashers like shabazz, Wiggins, and Lavine to get to the rim. Case in point - over half his touches on offense at duke came in the post - he can ONLY work low. To put that into perspective, ""dominant"" post players in the NBA only receive about 15 percent of their touches that close to the rim. If he can't learn to operate away from the paint, he's in trouble.

Combine this with an abysmal free throw percentage and ""hack a player"" a viable strategy in key moments, and I don't think it's fair to call him a sure-fire scorer at all.

"
"&gt; Who is he waiting for, Jesus Christ himself? JC for HC?

&gt;  I bet there are qualified candidates out there willing to take on this job. 

Yeahhhh..... I'm very much assuming this is speculation because no one knows whats happening but the organization. I agree with /u/Jmgill12 on the Flip-bashing culture, the homie was dealt with injury fill season and gets shitted on for it. I'm going to be patient and let everything develop. After Love left, we all knew this was going to happen no matter what."
"Of course it's speculation.  I never claimed otherwise.  ""No one knows what's happening but the organization"" is just a shield against criticism.  The counter-assertion that he's doing a secret search outside the watchful eye of the media is an even more intense form of speculation.  We have to go by what we hear from the media.  Which is nothing. 

""Flip-bashing"" is dismissive and makes it seem like I'm attacking him personally or something.  I and others have legitimate grievances with his philosophy and track record.   I just want him to do what he said he was going to do.  Hire a great coach.  Everyone defending Flip is taking a stance contrary to the one held by the two most powerful people in the organization.  ""We need to find a new coach.""  Flip's supporters are more gung-ho about him than Flip's own rhetoric is about himself.  That's not great ground to be standing on. 

&gt; After Love left, we all knew this was going to happen no matter what.

After Love left, Flip said we need to find a coach.  Then he hired himself and stopped looking. 

Additionally, the case against Flip is not based on 14-15, so the ubiquitous ""injury filled season"" apology rings hollow as well.  He lost the locker room in Detroit and got fired.  Washington fired him.  Minnesota fired him.  His record is not illustrious.  Skepticism is warranted."
"Yeah if he was just better he'd be better haha"

"Newb question but what is KenPom?"
"It's a highly regarded college basketball analytics system and website. It became popular after a string of extremely accurate NCAA tournament predictions in the mid 2000s. Ken Pomeroy was the face of basketball analytics before Daryl Morey randomly became that. 

His 360 offense / defense stats for teams and his player efficiency metric are some of the most successful ""advanced"" stats in the sport. He is extremely well known around places like /r/collegebasketball.

Edit: it's not a projection system like Pelton's so it's not meant to say who will have the better NBA career. It is just meant to quantify how good players and teams are at that level."

&gt;A measure of personal offensive efficiency developed by Dean Oliver. The formula is very complicated, but accurate. For a detailed explanation, buy Basketball on Paper. 


Also those assist, blocks, and defensive rebound differences..."
"Thanks man. That rebound rate for Towns looks awesome, especially given the beasts he was playing with. I didn't realize he was such a foul machine though - I guess in the Kentucky games I watched I didn't notice due to his low minutes. 

Also wouldn't have expected Jah's eFG% to be so much higher. I wonder if that disparity would be there if you only looked at games against common opponents and ranked teams - a common criticism of him is that he struggled to score on size.

And I've heard Okafor criticized for his turnovers but it looks like he's very similar to Towns there. "
"now people can stop claiming Oak for being a better passer."
"imagine if he had knees. pre injury robbie was gonna be a pretty darn good player. now he's just a bench guy. still think he's worth that last roster spot though he plays hard."
"Noticed that too. Probably didn't get called because there was less than 5 second left in the half."
"The fact that you're claiming Okafor wasn't even one of the better offensive players on his own team is silly. Dude just won a national championship as a freshman. He played a ton of minutes, had the offense run through him, and always commanded a double team because of how deadly of a scorer he is. That's like claiming LeBron was inefficient last night and should have given the ball to James Jones. Having a guy that needs to be doubled opens everything up for everybody else, and that's hard to show with stats alone."
"You are correct. I said this on a previous post... I think it fits here too.

Why would Towns or Okafor want to come here?

They would get ton a playing time allowing them to develop. (Sounds terrible)

Allowing them to develop could set themselves up to sign a max contract in the future. (They probably hate money)

Who wants to play along side the most promising young star in Wiggins? (They probably hate other good basketball players)

A market that wont run you out of town and put you under a microscope. Were just happy your here. (They would probably rather go to a place like LA to get ridiculed and savaged on a daily basis)

Its cold. (SHUT THE FUCK UP)"
"Toronto hears this a fair bit, too.
For the Raptors, it's the weather (cold, but milder than MN), the fact that it's in another country (taxes, customs, etc), and the fact that the fanbase can get a little... intense.  MN just has cold.

"Well trading love for Wiggins was a step in the right direction"

"Wait a few years for Wiggins to become a top tier superstar, and the players will come. Cleveland's cold and not a desirable destination but Lebron was able to get people here last offseason. In today's league the superstar will attract the role players. 

You guys won't have prospects blowing workouts in the 2018 draft when you're picking in the 20's. "

Towns could grow to that he can shoot, around 80% from the FT line (I think), but I'm not sure if his passing/ball handling can get there. 

His D very well could get to be were AD's is, and maybe even better. "
"ADs perimeter game doesn't quite stretch to 3 pt land does it? Wasn't that game winner his only made 3 at that point in the year last year? 

He does have a growing midrange game though which is extremely valuable. "
"I thought the reason Towns was so highly touted is because of his range on the offensive end + his defensive and rebounding abilities on the other side of the court vs okafor just being a low post savant. "
"These are pretty much all stats you can  get on basketball reference, why would you pay for them? "
"From what I've observed, I could obviously be wrong, is AD stretches further than Towns. Towns can knock down from the elbow but AD has the ability to be above the arc and attack. Just the ability to drive is something most big men lack. Not saying AD is a great 3 pt shooter, but as stated above his mid range game is already solid and I think he can expand and improve his decent 3 pt shot.(didn't convey that correctly in my 1st post) "
"Player stats are a VERY small part of what is on KenPom. Also use it for gambling purposes and try to arbitrage spreads"
"I wanna move to Minnesota to get Wolves season tickets. I can handle some cold."
"laker fan here, and most nba scouts, who would probably know more than you or me, admit that Okafor has a better low post game than ""most"" NBA centers today. "
"Towns has got a sweet stroke.

Im sure he can develop a 3pt game that at least demands respect from defenders"
"He most definitely can't stretch the D past the 3 point line. He can hit mid range pretty well but it's evident that he is not comfortable taking 3's at least in this point in his career."
"Yeah, people say the foul rates come from him being pretty undisciplined and biting on pump fakes. I mostly agree and that is something that can be corrected with coaching and time.

If anything, people say Okafor is a great passer. Rate stats show that Towns is better at passing and turns the ball over less. Those couple of percentage points for each are significant. "
"Cool, good to know. "
"What's really amazing is how close his True Shooting percentage is. This factors in free throw numbers, and that along with offensive rating and PER shows that Towns is actually very close to Okafor in total offensive efficiency. Given that and the overwhelming defensive advantage Towns has, it would be crazy to pick Okafor right now. "
"You, I like."
"They aren't all ""amazing"" but here's a link to the albums I made this year: http://icephoenix.imgur.com/

"I'm a Lakers fan and said that in the Lakers subreddit, which didn't go over smoothly. Towns/Okafor have a chance to join a potentially special team with Wiggins and Lavine. If those three develop as expected, players will be heading there in no time. 

"
"People use it for gambling. Straight up, that's what almost all his subscribers are there for. A few people won a crazy amount of money using his 360 team stats in the mid 2000s before the more people caught on.

The dude isn't a basketball dude necessarily either. I think he comes from like a risk assessment / financial engineering background."

"Might be the best post I have ever seen."
"Excellent."
"Don't draft Kevin love douche bags who clearly aren't going to stick around "
"I actually heard Durant has really small hands. Apparently he can't even palm a ball. There was some kind of picture of him palming two balls before he was drafted but the balls had to be deflated for it."
"How do you guys dislike Kevin Love? He told you he wasnt going to resign, allowing you guys to prepare and trade him away for the brightest part of your future. He did you a great favor and younare better off now."
"I don't know if KAT is laughing at this. He wanted to be a Knick. "
"The outside shot is not what sets them apart. If anything, Towns has the potential to be a dangerous 3-point shooter, which Davis does not possess (yet.) What sets Davis apart from Towns is that he is in another tier athletically, which raises his ceiling on both offense and defense. He is longer and knows how to use that size and skill to make a huge impact on the court, including a lot more steals in college at the same age. He is more disciplined with a more developed post game (at this point.)

I do things Towns has the potential to be a bit of a poor-man's Davis, though. Their advanced stats in college are pretty similar, with Towns arguably being even further along offensively."
"Very very good. With his length, he has the potential to be incredibly dangerous offensively. Like, a longer and more athletic Kevin Love if he develops his post game. "
"He wasn't going to stick around with an incompetent franchise. Minnesota has nothing to do with it. Dude is living in Cleveland for gods sakes lol."
"I still can't believe how it shook out.  I mean the Knicks won back to back games in the last week or so of the season to take them from the worst,  tied for worst, and then 2nd worst.  I'm not one to root for your own team to lose but to rack up those wins at that moment?  Damn bad timing.  "
"Different tier athletically. Davis is a better runner, quicker jumper, higher jumper, faster in a straight line and side to side.

And Towns has good ball handling for a center, but nothing close to the level of skill Davis has there.

He's more Al Horford (his most common NBA comparison) than Davis. He's projected to be an all star, not a total 100% franchise changer like AD."
"Dunno. No matter how odd it may seem but weather does play a huge factor. If you had the opportunity to go to Minnesota or Los Angeles solely based off of weather majority of people would go to Los angeles. I'm not saying that it is a major case but it will play a part. Will they blow workouts or interviews? Unlikely but you can't completely expect them not to be thinking about the living conditions. It will be there but it won't be in the forefront of their mind."
"Yeah it was a weird decision. Great for us though. "
"Wiggins, Towns, Lavine, Rubio... Ownership open to getting a better coach once our young guys have had some time to develop. KG around to impart his knowledge on these young guns. 

I'd say the future is looking damn bright in Minnesota. "
"I would argue that Love just wasn't meant for Minnesota. He was a great offensive player but his defense left way too much to be desired. I like how things played out with Love leaving and then us getting a high scoring swingman who can defend (and potentially rebound very well when he gets more experience). 

We sucked just long enough without Love to get the #1 pick. Call me delusional but I see us headed towards the same path as the Warriors where we make a beastly team by drafting well and picking up guys who can defend. Defenses win championships. "
"Anyone who doesn't want to play with Wiggins has some mixed up priorities. . "
"Yeah, haha one win was against Atlanta too. Crazy, if they lose that game we probably have the 4th pick and things look very different. "

St. Thomas runs a platoon system too.  They're constantly number 1 in D3 and have former D1 recruits/players coming off their bench playing no more than 20 minutes a night.

That's just what happens when you've got a ton of talent."
"The best answer is ""Do due diligence on both of them but if the lotto were today we'd pick Towns."""
"Towns was foul prone because as one scouting report put it he's the cookie monster of blocking shots. Something that is easily coachable. Combine that with Kentucky's overall depth in the front court and the fact that they were blowing out teams the minutes thing isn't an issue. DeAndre Jordan averaged only 20 mins a game in college, Roy Hibbert had low minutes due to foul proneness, same for Larry Sanders as well. Good defensive bigs usually figure that stuff out or start getting the benefit of the doubt from the refs.   

Edit: I forgot Cousins only averaged 23 minutes for Kentucky because of foul problems. He turned out alright. "

"Brewer is the fucking man, why would you wish bad upon such a decent guy?"
"Particularly relevant to the Okafor vs. Towns discussion. Lowe brings up a good point that while low-post scoring isn't necessarily the way to carry a team, the post-up game still has a place in the league, especially in combination with good passing from the post. I watched a decent amount of the Kings this year, and one of the things I enjoy most about Demarcus Cousins' game is his passing touch. It's a fascinating read, and another facet to the big discussion over the next month."
"This part is especially relevant, imo:

&gt;The ban on hand-checking unleashed speedy ball-handlers. Legalizing zone-style defense has made every post entry pass an adventure in needle-threading.

I've seen some arguments that the reason that their aren't many post-up Bigs anymore is because nobody is any good at posting up anymore, and that Okafor will ignite the revolution back towards low post Bigs. That sentence, though, shows why that won't happen. The reason that there aren't a ton of low post Bigs anymore isn't because guys don't know how to post, the reason is because rule changes in the early-mid 2000s made posting up much more difficult and much less rewarding relative to slashing. "
"Although the main crux of the article was the value of players being able to semi-effectively post-up defenders smaller than them. That's pretty different than Okafor being able to post-up at a high percentage against similar sized players. "
"Bill Walton being knocked out so soon is a travesty. "
"No Kevin collabro? "
"5 fouls per 36 isn't even enough to foul out in the nba so I'm pretty ok with that"
"Yep. It's interesting that Lowe brings up Okafor, since the article reads more like an endorsement of Towns' style of play - versatile offense, good shooting, but the ability to effectively post up when a smaller player switches on to him - and an indictment of Okafor's style - offense entirely predicated around low post scoring.

"Anyone who thinks we are drafting Okafor over Towns is delusional. Towns has a higher ceiling and fits the team. Okafor plays center exclusively, has no outside shot, and has questionable defense. Towns is a PF/C hybrid who can provide floor spacing and rim protection. There is absolutely no question that we draft Towns.

"I expected this article would sway me towards Okafor, but after reading it I think it just makes me want Towns more.

"""If only the Wolves had a player whose entire game was posting up...

"i upvoted you. i have no idea why ppl are being dicks. "
"Thank you sir"
"Like a more entertaining Gallagher! "
"Speed and Quickness. Dude gets eaten on PnRs.

Really wish he had some vert measurements. Because I'm pretty sure Town's athletic ability makes up for his 1 inch shorter standing reach.

It also isn't as if Okafor is completely hopeless at defense, he just isn't near KAT. KAT is just more versatile in every facet of basketball. "
"I think he can get better but the Wisconsin game worried me. Kaminsky was making him look silly on defense. Granted, Kaminsky was the player of the year and is a pretty solid athlete for a big white dude, but Okafor seemed like he was constantly behind on drives and that led to foul trouble. I don't see how that can hold up against the bigs of the NBA which is trending to being more athletic or how much faster he can really get."
"5 per 36 is almost 1 foul per 7 minutes. Which means he'd hit #6 around the 42/43 minute mark which is indeed enough to foul out in the NBA."
"Unless we get Thibs he'll almost never come close to that many minutes, regardless of foul trouble.

Actually even if we get Thibs he won't because Thibs doesn't play rookies."
"Because there aren't many bigs that were bad defenders in college that become above average defenders in the pros. I've seen scouting reports say he's lazy on defense which is not the kind of attribute you want from a big who is the last line of defense. From my own take on watching Okafor he doesn't look like he has the defensive instincts that good defenders have or the lateral foot speed to contain the roll man or the ball handler in what's become the bread and butter play in the league P'n'R.   

Not saying it'll never happen but he has a lot to work on to be successful at it. "
"[deleted]"
"Good question!

I guess the short of it is defensive instincts. Towns has much better shot blocking instincts, as shown by his 11.5 Block%, compared to 4.5% for Okafor. He is much better on defensive rotations and overall effort, and generally has a higher basketball IQ (especially on defense.) These are things that people say you can't teach, which is true to a certain extent. Effort on defense was a huge knock on Okafor last year. Towns was also a significantly better defensive rebounder. 

Towns is also lauded as being more athletic, which I think is true from watching him. He is quicker on his feet, and can keep with most any forward (and some guards.) 

http://fat.gfycat.com/OpulentScientificHousefly.webm

Both are obviously teachable and can, in theory, get better. A lot of people cite Marc Gasol and Andrew Bogut as potential comparisons for Okafor's defensive potential. Both were knocked for their defense and developed into pluses on that side. He has the size and potential there, but it's far from a sure thing that he ever develops to be above average on that side. It's sort of a one-in-the-hand vs. two-in-the-bush type of thing. Towns projects to be a plus defender pretty much right away (or as soon as he can learn to stay out of foul trouble.) Due to his superior athleticism, Towns also has huge upside on defense, whereas Okafor's is theoretically limited. 

Tried to stay relatively unbiased. "
"Because no one knows what they are talking about. He's going to be a phenomenal NBA player. I still think we will pick Towns but he's gonna be a beast one day."
"Okafor is going to be facing players who are a lot better than Kaminsky in the NBA..."
"Okafor honestly projects to be pretty hopeless at defense. Doesn't mean he will, but it doesn't look pretty. 

Towns on offense, on the other hand, is a different story. "
"I can see that. Jahlil didn't seem like the most mobile of big men. Kinda clunky with his movements"
"I feel like its a bigger jump and I'd doubt he get that many looks from 3 pt range. Numbers are promising and he does does have a nice stroke; I certainly wouldn't be against being proven wrong. "
"Speed is something you're limited to by genes. And yea, getting beaten that bad by Kanminsky doesn't help him that much at all. I was just thinking post ups he could play pretty good d and improve, but PnR is so prevalent today he can't keep up"
"I'd definitely say you were unbiased in that whole reasoning. I'd agree with that. Might be too big of a gamble with Okafor then as compared to Towns"
"Yea I agree. Can't go wrong with either. I was just thinking people criticized Okafor a little too much. Too high on Towns' defense and too low on Okafors'. Or at least wanted to hear what other people were thinking or had for reasoning. "
"Not to mention Jahlil played over 30 minutes per game, it's easier to play hard at 20 minutes a game and substitute like hockey and not play 3/4ths of a game like Okafor. I think Okafor, with the right development team can turn into a great defender."
"Good point. Seems like the Timberwolves have a really good problem, Okafor vs Towns. Right now seems like they can't go wrong either way"
"Agreed. I'm over here crying tears of rage. "
"Towns actually looks more clunky, but is still effctive"
"We are already a very bad defensive team.  Does adding a slow, seemingly unmotivated defender help us?  Not to mention that the Duke offense would have to wait for the Big O to make his way down the court.  How much of the twenty four second clock do you want to eat up waiting for your center to catch up to everyone else?"
"It's because he's in the discussion for our pick. Those guys you named have nothing to do with our team but Okafor does."
"effort, quickness, leaping ability"
"&gt; Effort on defense was a huge knock on Okafor last year. 

This is the main reason I don't buy him developing into a good defender. Defense is more about desire and mentality than anything. You have to really want to shut the other team down. That's about personality. Some people have the personality to grind it out and work to stop the other team from succeeding, and some don't. 

Beyond that, I don't think it's something that's likely to develop at this stage; at least not without some major motivating factor, and that factor isn't likely to come about. He's gotten all sorts of accolades, and he's about to be a top 2 pick in the draft despite not trying hard on D, so why should he suddenly care about it?"
"Duke has never suited big men. And I don't read too far into advanced statistics. In some cases they are very useful, but he's not as bad of a defender as he is made out to be. I think Towns is a better passer and defender but Okafor isn't THAT far behind. If advanced statistics were that much of a major decider in most NBA decisions, Wiggins wouldn't have won ROY or even been on 1st Team for Rookies. I do think that Towns is maybe better for our team and probably a better prospect right now, but people are undervaluing how good Okafor actually is."
"Yeah, the argument is: at this point in his life, after playing basketball since he was god knows how young, if he hasn't learned to defend well enough to defend college players then he's going to have a hell of a time guarding the best players in the world. 

It has a lot of merit. "
"Yeah, Towns definitely has much more versatility and there's a lot of value in that. If you read a lot of my posts, you'll see the stats say he was just as valuable on offense as Okafor last year. "
"Defense is about instincts, awareness, and athleticism (speed/quickness).


Things that you can't really teach.



Offense, however, is a lot about technique which is teachable."
"Rubio and a couple nice draft picks for ....... Eric Bledsoe??? WHO SAYS NO?!?!"
"Not sure if Suns would move him.  Just signed a five year max.  With that said, I would be ecstatic to grab him for Rubio.  "

"I'm more amazed by those catches! Holy crap."
"It's really refreshing to see a level-headed impartial analysis of each player's defensive potential, thanks!

People on here tend to get a little heated on these discussions. "
"Maybe a couple of picks and a player like dragic. But honestly were pretty solid with Ricky.(if he stays healthy) "
"His value is really low again after another serious injury. Not really any point in moving him since he's young yet, the Wolves aren't competing in the next 1-2 years, and we don't have a viable replacement. If the Wolves were picking 3-4 and were thinking about Mudiay or Russell, then it would make more sense."
"Legitimate claims or not I'd rather not move him. There are very few teams which need a starting level point guard so we wouldn't get anywhere near equal value for him."
"I don't think we are in a position to trade draft picks."
"I mean I'm more concerned that Coach K often benched Jahlil at the end of close games because his poor free throw shooting ability and the fact he can't really switch onto guards at all."
"rubio and Dieng plus a couple of pick swaps and some high second rounders could net him"
"No, because I dont believe he will shoot 33.3 percent from inside three feet and really no one should IMO. While he isnt really a good finisher, that number is low because of his injury and the crowded offense the wolves had at times, especially with Pek in"
"whether it be Towns or Okafor...they are just gravy to this G 

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
"The Suns, if reports about what the Wolves were offering last year are any indication."
"Realistically, Ty Lawson would be the best bet.  Nuggets seem to really want to move him, and he's still really good imo.  Assuming he can stay healthy, I'd still rather have Ricky, though."
"Best Wiggins mix I've seen so far. Pretty crazy this is all from his rookie year. Not a huge fan of the Maple Jordan nickname though. Let him make is own name."
"Fun fact about Ty Lawson every season he's attacked the basket less and less instead opting for long 2s. His shooting percentages have taken a large hit because of it. He's also not a good defender. "
"That spin move is orgasmic"
"I really hope we don't trade Ricky... I love him."
"I like Air Canada personally "
"Crazy idea with a .0001% chance of happening and working out. We draft Jah, trade Rubio for a mid to late first round pick, and pick up Tyus with that pick"
"Great work again.  I like how it shows a variety of his skills rather than just dunks.  Plus can't go wrong with 2pac."
"I know you said to ignore the legitimacy, but he *just* signed an extension last summer.  These idiotic click whore media turds are just trying to start some crap."
"&gt; Duke has never suited big men.

Was that sarcasm?

Christian Laettner at Duke = Arguably the greatest college player of all time.

Christian Laettner in the NBA = A bubble All-Star who couldn't even get into the playoffs unless he was the third or fourth best player on the team.

Not to mention Duke's LOOOOOONG history of great college bigs, many of whom were notorious NBA busts."
"Pretty sure vince Carter already had that name "
"Yea didn't Flip try exactly this lol"
"I really thought this could happen a few weeks ago before we won the pick. I really thought we were gonna be picking 2 jus cuz u know conspiracy and shit. Towns woulda gone 1 we would pick Okafor no.2. Given how hard it is to move a big contract like Pek, we'd almost certainly have to juggle playing time between 3 centers who all deserves PT. Instead of that we could just trade Dieng for that mid-late round pick for Tyus.  I think Dieng is worth that much but if we get Okafor there's no way flip would wanna juggle 3 centers or try to play one at the 4.  We'd almost have to find a starting 4 in free agent. "
"Yeah never suited big men is pretty crazy. Elton Brand was a wooden award winner and went #1 overall because of his awesomeness at Duke. Grant Hill, Carlos Boozer, Cherokee Parks, Sheldon Williams. "

"Yep Doogie and Zgoda were trolling on twitter. The only reliable reporter Jon Krawczynski got a quote from Rubio himself saying he wanted it to make it work here. "
"Wow. I can see why Canada is so proud of him. Watching Wiggins play is just an absolute privalege. But having him on our team is a blessing. He is gonna be great."
"Wait for his value to go up, he's a young player on a young team and MN shouldn't be making any big trades anytime soon. Once other teams start seeing him lobbing it up to AW and KAT next year in the playoffs then maybe we would consider ;)"
"Nice mix man, good job"
"Err"
"IMO it would be a horrible mistake to trade him. I'm a firm believer in selling high and Rubio's trade value at the moment is low for what it can/should/will be. The mentality right now should be about learning how to play with each other and aiming for the playoffs. We would still be years away from title contention and a trade like this wouldn't speed up the process."
"This was great."
"Plus, his stock isn't exactly high since he missed nearly half a season with his ankle injury.

You never sell low."

"If we're in the playoffs next year, Ricky would be a a huge reason why and trading him would set us back."

"Another classic.  Great chops there Percy!"
"Lol. Why trade him at his lowest value?  Rubio healthy for a month gets double his value now.

Plus, LaVine isn't a PG. That's why the rumors exist."
"I would not want to trade Rubio for Tyus straight up though"
"On the pick and roll he always stays with the big man. He has to improve this, too. His shooting was improving, his leadership too. My only wish with Ricky is that he can stay healthy. First step, next season. If this happen we'll all be happy because he's awesome to watch. And moreover, he would be able to develop more. Now it seems as if we hadn't watched him played for years! Hahaha, I miss him."
"Wow, dude looks amazing!"
"The Maple Jordan is my favourite. He's like Mike and he's Canadian. It fits."
"Alpha. Because we're wolves and he's the alpha wolve."
"I like Ender."
"*Wolf"
"Agreed. Also, if he is letting the situation in Denver get to his head and affect his play (which I think it is with both him and Faried), then I don't see that being a positive situation here in Minny at least for a couple years (at which time he may jet looking for more $$$ elsewhere)."
"I'd really like to come up with a nickname that isn't a play on his name, MJ's name, or his number. Too many players (by which i mean star players) nowadays go with shorter versions of their name (Melo) or their initials and/or their number (CP3). I want to get back to nicknames like the big ticket, the mailman, the diesel, etc.  
  
Unfortunately, I'm not creative enough to come up with something though."

"&gt; they have 4 on the perimeter nearly every offensive possession,

Which is something that makes a guy like Okafor (the 1 in) look better, not worse. "
"Probably 80-20 in favor of KAT, though I'd say the majority of us wouldn't riot if we chose Jahlil."
"&gt; ""I think Okafor could be a transcendent low post guy""

Not if he can't make his free throws. "
"Pretty much this. Happy with either, with a preference for Towns."
"It's pretty heavily skewed for KAT. The general consensus is that he's at least as good of a player as Okafor is and is a much better fit for our team."
"Hmmm I'd say KAT not only because I think the Twolves really need defense but also because of his massive upside."
"Jim Pete is the man"
"Hack-a-who again?"
"I stopped that line of thinking after Cousins went from crap D to great."
"&gt; is a much better fit for our team.

The only player Flip should even be considering chemistry with our rookie should be Wiggins. Everyone else is pretty expendable. You take BPA at this pick. "
"I meant in terms of him filling our teams' weaknesses. We need a center who can defend the pick and roll, defend the rim, and operate outside of the post to clear it for Wiggins/Bazz post ups.

FWIW those two have played together and seem to be friends. Chemistry wouldn't be an issue.

I'd also argue he's BPA anyways."
"This, basically. Most people prefer KAT but would be fine with Okafor. Some prefer Jah and would be fine with KAT. But there are a minority who want Towns and are acting like they'll jump off a bridge if Jahlil is taken."
"I think I woud be pretty upset if we took okafor.  I think I would get over it and cheer for him, but I really like towns."
"But KAT has an edge in that as well. Towns and Wiggy are relatively close to one another."
"Seriously he's the reason I started rooting for this team, idk how I'd cope"
"That's a good case for someone who can play d now. All okafor needs is a jumper tho"
"Get Wiggy With It"
"I can make an argument both ways for them, and how either or would be amazing to have. Why to pick KAT over Okafor and vise versa. "
"We all know Shaq and Wilt were terrible players. Just look at their FT%s. "
"For me, it's Towns and then Russell. Jahlil is my #3"
"The Wiry Wolf

The Stepback Kid

Bounce and Trounce

The Placid Posterizer

I don't fuckin know

lol I like Drew North the more I think about it."
"I'm surprised at Towns' relative lack of proficiency in help defense considering his agility and length.  Maybe he tends to gamble for blocks, while Okafor is more realistic and concerned with staying grounded in driving lanes.  It does make Okafor seem like less of a defensive black hole.  Maybe a Pekovic-type level of competence?  

STILL WANT TOWNS"
"Yeah I think a big part of this is Towns's lack of discipline he showed, which resulted in his high foul rates. He would often come over to help, bite on a pump fake and foul the shooter. A lot can be linked to that one pretty big weakness, and I really hope it can be coached out of him. We saw the same high foul rates from G and Pek, who both obviously got much better. "
"1/2 Man, 1/2 Amazing is a street baller's name."
"This is really great, good find FS. Definitely supports what I've been saying- Towns was actually not behind Okafor at all when it comes to efficiency and value on offense. "
"A lot of numbers and stats guys are Towns-or-bust, and rightfully so. Dude kills okafor when it comes to advanced stats, and in theory the stats have seen more of their play than any of us. I will be pretty upset if we draft Okafor, less so if we take Russell (which is pretty unlikely.) "
"This is only true to a certain extent. There is no LeBron or Ant Davis in this draft. If we were stacked with bigs and needed a guard, I'd be hoping for Russell. As our roster is currently constructed, we have a number of wings and guards with potential but need spacing, rebounding and rim protection. We have players who we are keeping because we can't trade them or are hoping they well develop. Drafting okafor would not make any sense, even if he were even with Towns, which he's not. If the top is as close as it is, fit factors in and Towns is both the best big and best fit, making him kind of a no-brainer.

The reason we aren't considering Russell is because we are desperate for bigs, so fit is factoring in. "
"Wolves having interest in Hoiberg isn't news. Flip tried to get him in Minnesota last year but in part due to the uncertainty of the Kevin Love situation and his commitment at Iowa State it never happened. Now I have a hard time believing Flip is going to give up his coaching job any time soon whether Hoiberg wants to come to back to the Wolves or not. "
"I'd be surprised if we actually offer him the position, I think Flip wants to coach too badly. I would be angry if we didn't attempt to reach out to him, so I'm happy to hear this."
"Either way, I like KAT but I wouldn't be angry with Okafor. They both can become great "
"Right now I still slightly favor Okafor but not by much.  I am just glad we get a chance at either of them!"
"That's you, I would personally be pretty upset if we took Okafor over Towns. You are right that they both can become great, but all we can do now is draft the better prospect. Which is Towns. "
"I can respect that totally "
"I know right? It's obviously Towns"
"Ha :)  I expected that"
"Let's talk more about trading the pick."
"Legitimate question: would you rather see no new content for a week +? Cuz at this time that's pretty much all we have. Although I'll give you that it's just more of the same with few exceptions "
"Trade back draft Tyus... As much as I would want that it is not happening :("
"Trade from 1 to 15-20? That'd have to be some trade package lol"
"or take him #1.  This is why I am not anywhere close to running a team"
"I wouldn't mind it if people were level headed about Okafor. Posters are sometimes downright condescending when someone even entertains the idea that Okafor might be a good player. 

Not even the suggestion they should pick him but to entertain the idea he'll be good! Nope, got to trash the kid and make him out to be a sure bust who a gm would have to be certifiably insane to pick.  

\#Okaforhascooties"
"Lol, I'm like an addict trying to read every opinion to somehow get an inkling of who we're going to pick.

I was like reading Zgoda's twitter replies to people and shit.


Also, Zgoda's kind of a dick to people on twitter..."
"Flip won't give up coaching until he can get the Wolves back in the playoffs.  He has to have developed a chip on his shoulder after losing his job in DC and coming off a league worst record to vindicate his coaching ability."
"Package our second rounders and trade up to get him (if possible)."
"Vince Carter – ""Air Canada"", ""Vinsanity"", ""Half Man Half Amazing""; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nicknames_used_in_basketball
might be a street baller two but VC had that nickname for sure."
"Yeah, you are right. I read up on it after I posted that. There was a street baller with the nickname, but also used for VC."
"I am also in that party.  My eye test says KAT.  Obviously had to make sure my eyes werent lying or it wasnt just the games I was watching but he just seems like a guy who will have a great career for 15-20 years and potentially be great.  Okafor could certainly have a great career but I see towns dominating in todays game "
"I think hoiberg and izzo are the two guys flip would give up the job to let coach"
"yeah its annoying when they have a ton of nicknames"
"I would have agreed with you last year, but now that he his guys in Wiggins, LaVine, and the #1 pick it will be hard to tear him away from that."
"Cousins was a poor defender his rookie year. He's also a gifted passer like Okafor and was seen as a little lazy.

I've been in Towns corner but that doesn't mean the arguments for Okafor aren't very good. He's not just a little better on offense than Towns. He's a lot."
"I feel the same way and do the exact same things haha"
"Flip interviewed him last year. Van Gundy convinced Flip he should be the coach of the Wolves. "
"same... just draft K.A.T and call it a day"
"As a Wolves fan who goes to ISU, this confuses me emotionally."
"You're delusional if you think flip wouldn't give up his position for hoiberg."
"You're delusional if you'd think a guy that absolutely loves coaching over everything would willingly walk away and give up the opportunity to coach Wiggins, this year's number 1 pick, and a roster of his own design. "
"It would be nice, his range and defense would help, but he is going to be much too expsensive."
"We have too many wings. "
"We have a surplus of wings and he will want to go to a contending team I would assume."
"He's going to be fairly expensive, and we already have more wings than we know what to do with. He is a fantastic 2-way player though."
"Our GM/coach does fairly regular interviews on the local sports talk radio station and the premier host is convinced that he tipped his hand and suggested that we are eyeing up Okafor.  I personally don't really care who we go with, but I think a lot of people need to prepare for us sticking with number one overall and not ending up with KAT."
"I totally asked this a while back!!! I like the idea but we are too full at the 2-3...."
"It's funny to me that people think Flip has any interest at all in giving up his coaching spot. Dude is his own boss (twice), coaches with his son and will have three #1 overall picks on his roster next year--why the heck would Flip give that up to a college coach coming off major heart surgery??"
"I know you're being facetious but Okafor is no Shaq or Wilt and free are becoming increasingly important in the league."
"We have no cap space"
"You act as if he hasn't offered the position to izzo, hoiberg, and was damn near close to hiring joeger. You guys act like flip waiting for a quality coach is a bad thing."
"Cool that was a year ago before Wiggins, and before he got the #1 pick. The cards changed. He isn't waiting for a coach anymore, he isn't even looking. It's Flip's spot, he's going to coach until he doesn't want to anymore. That could be another season or five.   

Let me also make it clear Flip didn't decide to become the head coach of the Wolves to develop the young players he came back to win games. You have to believe that's still his motivation, he legit thinks he's going to be the teams savior and bring it back to the promise land he previously got the team to.  "
"I think we're good at the wings(good depth too). Let bazz and Lavine develop. How many years are left in Chase and Kevin martin's contract?"
"No"
"We have so many wing players!  But what about Paul Millsap...."

"
"What can he do?? Is he any good?"
"Chase has one year left, I *think* Kmart has two.

Edit: also, Pek has three years left."
"It's unfortunate, with all the fieasco that went down with Royce and his psychological problems. But with a great Droctors and a diligent program that Royce has worked on for too much time no. It's time to focus on the future of advocacy  in mental health awareness and bringing Royce White and those moster numbers from ISU. http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/players/royce-white-1.html"
"What I mean is can he shoot? Or what's he good at? And he prolly won't get signed by us because we have a long jam at the wings. I hope other teams give him a chance thou."
"I included his statistics in the last post that i left you.  He'd play the stretch four in the League just like he did in colllege, He lead his team to the dance while being more efficient an leading his other players in almost every statistical category. If he didn't have his school misconduct issues and Mental Health Illness issues in the situation that we could be talking about a top ten draft pick here . "
"He is not a good jump shooter. He is a fantastic passer though. I would rather try and bring Bjelica over him though."
"i think the best way for Wiggins to get an original nickname is just to play and play more games. As soon as he develops his own game, the nicks should appear as well."
"Kinda rolls off the tongue smoothly :D"
"Maple Jordanis definitely the favorite, as what I have seen in Reddit so far."
"Politely implying. Very Andrew like."
"Pek nor Dieng will be playing the PF position lol. It'll be probably be KG for 20-25min, then Payne/Bennett.

Flip has said things about Martin possibly coming off the bench so he can add another 4-5 years to his career. But who knows.

* PG: Rubio
* SG: Martin/Shabazz
* SF: Wiggins
* PF: KG
* C: Towns/Okafor

If they went Okafor they'd never be able to play him and Pek together maybe not even with Dieng either.. I like Towns cause he could probably play with any of our current bigs.

"
"Rubio 

Martin 

Wiggins 

KG

Pek 

That's to start the year at least. I don't believe whoever we draft will start. "
"PG: Rubio

SG: LaVine

SF: Wiggins

PF: ???

C: Towns/Okafor

LaVine is very clearly in Flip's plans for the future and he has considered the option of bringing in KMart off the bench, so while Zach might not get the start immediately, I think he'll certainly get the role sometime during the season."
"I don't have a positive image of him, sadly. All I remember is him trash talking the competition, refusing to play and then trashing his own team when they sent him down to the D-league. 

I hope he's better mentally than before, and wish him luck with salvaging a pro basketball career, but I don't wish to waste a roster spot to be his next team. "
"If he won't coach for us, can he be a new commenter? Guy is witty as all hell. "
"There is no way Pekovic plays minutes at PF much less is he a starter. We tried it with Dieng this past season but it wasn't so effective that's way I think he will play some time there, but won't start even though he is far too good to be the third string center. My guess is that we try and lure a veteran PF to fill the four spot void, with Garnett and Payne sharing minutes at backup. 

Rubio

Martin

Wiggins

FA

KAT / Okafor

Basically this, unless we play Muhammad at the three and have Wiggins at the two for some time.



EDIT: Forgot about Bjelica, who could also be in the conversation."
"100% agree with everything you said. This is Flip's last chance. Sure, he probably enjoyed being the team president. But now he gets to have his cake and eat it too. Plus he is under the cover of us being a rebuilding team, so any coaching deficiencies he has can easily be masked by inexperience, youth, etc. Throw in that if people start calling for his head he still has his part ownership and team president position to fall back on and you have a man not only with the best hand, but all the cards in the deck."
"[deleted]"
"I'm pulling for that haha"
"I wouldn't be mad if we took Okafor, but my disappointment would be off the charts. I am of the opinion that you need a good low post defender to succeed in the NBA today. KAT is just that. He can also defend the perimeter as well is the low post. He's a great FT shooter and he has shown a lot of promise on the offensive side of the ball. Okafor on the other hand is a talented scorer and a good passer. He was a pretty average defender in college and I think his slowness will make him a bad defender in the NBA. KAT isn't just a better fit, he is IMO a better *overall* player. "
"He' so Canadian which fits so perfectly in Minnesota. I love Wiggy. =D"
"Would Towns not be able to play the 4? The starting lineup I'd really like to see is:  
  
PG- Rubio  
SG- Shabazz/Martin  
SF- Wiggins  
PF- Towns  
C- Pek  
  
I think this puts Pek in a position to succeed (aka making up for him on D). I also think that technically KG will start the PF spot regardless, but Towns could play more of the minutes. Hence me putting Towns in."
"PG: Rubio (unless injured)

SG: Kevin Martin (unless injured or traded he's starting no matter what)

SF: Wiggins (no question here)

PF: KAT (I know he's a center, but he's perfectly capable of playing PF and defending stretch 4's or centers)

C: Pek (unless injured, he's still better than Deing)"
"Who do you like in the up coming FA pool? Maybe we could cut some guys and pick up some vets."
"I wouldn't get my hopes too high, probably someone like Bass or something. "
"Not that it really matters but Shabazz is much more of a SF than a SG. "
"Ugh. "
"My dream lineup:
Rubio/T Jones
Martin/Lavine
Wiggins/Bazz
KG/Bjelica
Pek/KAT/Dieng"
"Very Canadian-like."
"Is this Bjelica dude any good? I just got back to basketball and I haven't heard of him."
"If he puts in one season of relative productivity with relatively decent effort on defense and stays relatively healthy, I'll upgrade my opinion of him from ""doesn't belong in the NBA"" to ""a slightly overpaid bench player.""

I'm not holding my breath though.  He really sucks."
"It's no secret that he had two terrible years, even though he improved during his time in Minnesota. I for one am still a believer and think that if he gets it together he can at the very least be a decent role player and be a spark off the bench. 

I think that he has the physical ability and the gift, but when watching him I feel like his biggest issue is his lack of confidence. I think the ""bust label"" really took a toll on the dude and he feels like the victim of all this hate. 

To be fair, he did miss out on about thirty or so games so it's not like we could watch him all season long. He definitely bulked up over the last off season and I think he's going to do the same this year. It'd be great to see him regain his confidence and go back to being the college player he was, at least to some degree. 

To answer your question though, I think that he should still be considered part of the teams future."
"A Bazz-like re-commitment to work ethic and paying more attention to how to help a *team* out as a role player than to just go through your small skillset trying to do your thing."
"Spark off the bench seems more likely, except that he has confidence issues. If he had the mindset of ""They just put me in with the second team. I'm the star now. I need to take over for the next four minutes,"" that might be the best role for him."
"&gt; Relatively

That's all I saw. Like nineteen times :)"
"KAT fits so much better. That's the only real reason why I'm much more in favor of him. If we were building a team from scratch and had zero players on the roster, I wouldn't mind too much either way, with only a minor preference toward KAT. But KAT makes far more sense on this team, so I feel it's a no-brainer *given the circumstances*."
"JJ Redick and Jodie Meeks are the best players in the NBA right now.

[Proof](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/player-stat/free-throw-percentage)"
"Repeated intentionally for emphasis.  The bar he needs to clear is pretty low, and I'm still not convinced he will do it."
"You're delusional about Pek or Dieng starting at the four.

KAT would make much more sense playing the four, and that's still kind of silly. He might be a 4/5 off the bench type of guy this year.

KG, if he plays, could ceremoniously start, with Payne, Bennett and maybe KAT playing the backup (and bulk) of the minutes.

Pek at the 5, Rubio at the 1, Martin the 2 and Wiggins the 3.

As much as I'd like to see Wiggins and Bazz both start and give the defense fits trying to cover them both, if Martin's here, he has to start."
"No. He's insane. Let him prove himself in the D-league."
"How much will he cost?

EDIT: [He only made $9.5 million this past year](http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/millspa01.html)

So... while he'll definitely need a pay raise, he might be ""affordable."""
"[Jeez](http://www.spotrac.com/nba/minnesota-timberwolves/chase-budinger/)

100% dead cap space? What a contract :/

And Kevin Martin might be kind of cheap, but there's no way he's being cut:

http://www.spotrac.com/nba/minnesota-timberwolves/kevin-martin/

Insane dead cap space."
"Especially to a team that drafts that low. They'd have to give us like four or five future 20-something picks. Which will never happen and can't even legally happen, I don't think. You can't trade consecutive years. So they'd have to trade us every other first-round pick for the next *decade*."
"Not sucking would be a great start.  Showing some hustle/energy/emotion maybe.  I really want him to develop, but my expectations are pretty low at this point."
"Agreed. From my perspective in section 118 all season, he seems to lack intangibles. These are hard to quantify, yes, be he seems to lack commitment (as evidenced in part by his steady weight gain during the season) and drive (his penchant or nothing but long two-pointers). 

He lacks aggression to put himself into the action, like Shabazz. He doesn't seem to know where to be on defense, when to pass, and takes that long 2 all day. That's all he shoots on warm-ups as well, BTW. I lost count of the number of times I saw him (when he actually got minutes) catch the ball 1-2 feet inside the arc, take a quick look for an easy pass, and jack up a jumpshot. Over and over. 

I thought there was potential when he came to camp in shape and with all the excuses fell Cleveland, I was willing to give him a mulligan. Suffice to say, dude couldn't get minutes on a 16-66 team. 

I can't see the back of him fast enough. "
"Pek needs to limit minutes, so I could see him anchoring the second team. Here's what I would do with the team:

Rubio
Wiggins/Lavine
Bazz 
Payne
Towns/Pek

I would (and I think Flip will) trade Martin and/or Dieng. I think wiggins is better at SG than SF and the numbers bear that out from last season. Payne is the weak spot in the rotation so deal Dieng/Martin for a PF. I hope KG retires (as much as we all love him, carrying to injury-prone centers isn't a good idea). 
"
"This kinda hints upon why I like Towns better than Okafor: he can play PF as well as C.  Theoretically, you could spell Garnett with Towns at PF and run with Pek/Dieng at C.  A Dieng/Towns combo in the low post would give you some great length ~~if~~ when opponents drive past the perimeter defense and into the paint.
"
"If we would somehow combine Bennett and Payne into one player, we would get a decent back up big man. For me, I have seen enough of Bennett to know he has skills but he lacks the confidence to really show them off and for Payne he has all the confidence in the world but he doesn't have the skills."
"A miracle. "
"Idk I'd entertain something from Milwaukee where we get 17, Giannis, Parker, and lose Pek. Obviously not a realistic scenario though."
"Yeah, I agree with that. I feel if Bazz does start he's the SF and Wiggins is the SG.

But I still feel Martin is starting even though flip had those comments about 6th man to help his career."
"That's why I'd take Payne over Bennett, many skills can be learned but you need confidence and effort. We've seen those from Payne and we've seen a serious lack of that from Bennett."
"It's already been 100% confirmed KAT will be a Wolf ever since he [favorited this tweet](http://i.imgur.com/1qZf36r.jpg)"
"That is a horrible trade for the Bucks, even if it were more realistic."
"We know KAT wants to go #1 and be in a Timberwolves jersey next season.

Flip...pls"
"I agree"
"Giannis *and* Parker, when we have a massive logjam at the wing? That's silly even for us, let alone them."
"Parker's a 4 isn't he? Idk, obviously not a realistic idea but it would probably take something like that value wise to actually move that far back."
"Towns is a smart kid to know we offer the best basketball future for him. Still feels weird typing that."
"hahahaaha... ummm a new coach who gets him to do something beyond drift and take long twos would be a start but I doubt anyone can fix AB. "
"I'm all for bringing Pek off the bench. I don't like the starting- / finishing lineup to rely on him due to his high injury rate."
"I just want to slowly develop him as a player that's probably not going to be good for quite a while."
"Hack-A-For"
"I'm still high on the kid... I think that if he gets quality minutes in the 1st team, he could average 15/10 no problem.

The problem last year was when he was in the game, he was in with people pulling his ceiling down.  

If you gave the guy 10 starts with the following line-up (Rubio, Wiggins, Bazzy, AB, Dieng) he would shine.  

Now assuming we grab Towns in the draft, our second lineup could quite nice too.

1st - Rubio / Wiggins / Bazzy / Towns / Dieng

2nd - LaVine / Martin / ? / AB / Pek
"
"Yes. He's good. Euroleague MVP, took his mediocre team to the final four this year."
"No, he plays more three now. Maybe in his thirties he might switch to full time four."
"Same here, I was new to basketball a few years ago and Ricky was my favorite player, he was so fun to watch. Injuries have held him back and I really do not hope we trade him."
"Shrooms laced with LSD"
"1) Rubio
2) Wiggins

"I agree, if you're tired of it, come back after the draft. This sub truly has nothing else  to discuss about anything this big so it's not going away anytime soon. Sorry to say homie"
"I'm thinking Rubio-Wiggins-Bazz-KG*-Towns.

*with Bjelica playing the most minutes at the 4"
"He's LeBron James Light (very light). Big bodied, very mobile PF."
"How is it so many of you forgot about KfuckingG starting at the PF?!?! Jesus Tapdancing Christ. 

Rubio
Martin
Wiggs
KG
Pek(if he is healthy at the start of the season)

"
"When did this happen? I regularly listen to the Fan and didn't hear this"
"Always hard to tell with Euros, but he was MVP of the Euroleague this year. I have admittedly only watched one game of his and some highlights but I'm impressed. He a stretch four who can shoot, drive, and rebound and I really hope we sign him!"
"Not over JPete..."
"For the record, KG has started every single game he has played in since his Rookie Season.

I don't forsee that changing soon. "
"He needs to improve his shooting, I want him to be atleast a 10/6 guy next year"
"PG - Rubio

SG - Martin

SF - Wiggins

PF - KG

C - Pekovic"
"PLEASE&lt;3"
"Good job, smiles. "
"he has some worrying trends, I'm not sure I want him."
"Could Anthony Bennett become a Draymond Green type of player off the bench?  Provide depth at the 3/4.  If so, lets keep him!"
"If we could get him or hoiberg it would make this the greatest offseason ever. "
"I'm going to be pissed if Hoiberg ends up in Chicago and not here!"
"My mom and her boss works with Brewer to help mange the businesses he owns in his hometown and he is one of the main reasons I became a T-wolfs fan but, no matter where he plays he will always be one of my favorite players to watch.
Quality guy on and off the court."
"I'd be shocked if Flip pursued him, honestly"
"It was the morning after the draft lottery and PA opened his show with Flip.  Flip didn't say anything too glaring at the time, but after a couple of days of PA and Nordo going back and forth about the underlying meaning to the interview PA had convinced himself that he knew what Flip was trying to say.  It was comments like ""We'll take the guy we like"" and ""you take the best player available even if it isn't your biggest team need"" that led him to believe the franchise is favoring Okafor even though the popular opinion is to take Towns.  "
"I want him off the team, he is a waste of a roster spot IMO."
"Highly agree."
"Me too, I'm surprised to see so many are enthusiastic, but I'm with you."
"I wouldn't quite know how to feel. I personally think Flip is not a good coach, so either him or Hoiberg would be an upgrade. I don't think we have a shot at Hoiberg, so Thibs would be the best option right now. He seems to get the best out of his players, but I would worry about our players burning out as he loads the starters with minutes. 

But in the end, Thibs wins and that is all that matters. And I think winning would be pretty cool."
"Draymond's value IMO comes from his superior defense. He had that from the moment he came into the league. I don't see AB developing into what Draymond is, but he could deifnitely develop into an offensive sparkplug off the bench (like others have noted here). Anthony Bennett's worst enemy is Anthony Bennett unfortunately."
"No way Flip would mesh with him IMO. Flip wants control, Thibs NEEDS control.  
  
With that aside, I would take him in a heartbeat. I think the Bulls next year could be like the warriors this year. They had the right coach to put them in position, and now they need a coach to get them over the top. Mark Jackson did that for the warriors and I think Thibs similarly did that for the Bulls. Obviously these are different situations as the Bulls don't have Steph Curry, but I bet the Bulls rise back to a top 2 team in the east next year."
"He reminds me of Adleman in a bad way in that he seems to prefer ""proven"" vets over young guys and the last thing this team needs is for the young guys to not get playing time."
"No, his ballhandling is too weak and his bbiq is too low. Green is that good because he can also create for others. "
"No."
"I don't see it as a big possibility for us.

I love the idea of it. Thibs is very defensively focused which is what our team is in dire need of. He's been proven as a leader and held up as one of the top coaches in the league outside of the Bulls FO.

That being said, I've heard lots of rumblings about him going to NO.

With the way our luck has gone lately between holding out to get Wiggins and now securing the #1 pick, in going to hold my breath that Hoiberg changes his mind. His coaching style fits really well with our young team, and I think it would be a great chance for them to develop with him before being ready to compete in another year or two."
"Nah, fuck Royce White.


Plus we dont need another mediocre 4."
"Lol, that's such a huge lineup wih Bazzy at SG."
"I like to see him play more minutes with Rubio, he seems to actually have value during that time."
"Yeah, unless he's hurt he's gonna be starting."
"No that was last offseason when we traded shoulder-boy for Maple Jordan"
"No thanks. I was worried enough considering Flip gave Wiggins the most minutes in the league in the back half of the season. "
"I would rather have Scotty. Same exact coach but Scotty is better at developing.

I don't understand why Thibs doesn't get the same criticism that Scotty gets."
"PG: Rubio

SG: Wiggins/Martin

SF: Bazz

PF: KG/Towns

C: Dieng/Pek 
"
"If he's taking NBA interviews and the Wolves FO didn't at least meet with him I will be picketing in front of target center"
"I never understood why he came out of college when he did.  He knew he wasn't going to be mentally healthy enough to deal with the travel schedule of an NBA player.  Plus, everyone knew he wouldn't be a lottery pick and he had a phenomenal chance at winning a national title."
"Yeah well I went to college with him and used to see him drunk at RueBar so dibs.

Edit: I think I actually told him not to bother coming back if they didn't beat Kentucky at Rubb (jokingly). Man. College. "
"Rubio

Martin or LaVine or Wiggins

Wiggins or Shabazz (Bazz is NOT a SG)

KG or Towns

Towns or Okafor or Dieng

Pek may not even be able to play at all anymore, I'd be shocked if he starts next year. I'd be even more shocked if the number 1 overall pick doesn't start, especially after Wiggins started all 82 games last year. "
"Haha yeah it is. The NBA is moving to a switching defense kind of league though, and at least everyone 1-4 could hold their own on pretty much anyone. Maybe not Rubio guarding 4s, but he's tall enough to at least make the other guy uncomfortable."
"Hoiberg does run sets that would be perfect for the Wolves.  

[Zach LaVine was born for this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ehcva_ZjqHQ).   

[Wiggins and Bazz could get easy buckets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PevMvVOjka8).  

"
"He does that why he got fired "
"Crappy medical staff and a coach with a history of running players into the ground? What could go wrong!"
"That scouting report doesn't sound like Bennett at all. Considering Payne is on the roster, plus the possible addition of Nemanja Bjelica, and having to move Gorgui over to the PF spot I don't see any possible minutes from him unless there is huge improvement from him. I don't see him as part of the Wolves future and merely a bit player in the Wolves present. "
"&gt; and will have three #1 overall picks

Can people stop saying that as if Bennett is an asset?  Because most people thought, way back on 2013 draft day, that it was insane to pick him with the #1, and his short career thus far has proven that out and then some."
"He's in a nice situation there in Houston with a role that really compliments his skill set.  Good luck moving forward, Brew."
"You're right, Bennett's looked absolutely terrible thus far. He still went tops in a draft and was a major part (albeit definitely less so than Wiggins) of the Love trade. It's not outrageous to believe a 22 year old that went that highly in a draft still has potential to be an asset. Especially if we're stepping into the mindset of a coach trying to develop youngsters, like Flip. Anyway, the real point of my post was to say that there's no fuggin' way Flip gives up all this young potential he's compiled to someone unproven coaching professionals and coming off a serious health issue. "
"Most NBA contracts are fully guaranteed."
"We better take Kat.  Please god.  Let us take Kat."
"I don't think either lineup will look anything like that..."
"Agreed, but you know Payne is gonna get minutes at the 4. There's no chance they trade him/stick him at the end of the bench after JUST trading a 1st rounder for him.

Have KG and Martin in the starting lineup, each playing about 20 minutes a night. And let LaVine and Payne take up the rest of the minutes at their positions. 

(And pray Payne takes a huge step forward in his second season and becomes a quality 3&amp;D stretch power forward.)"
"Love Shabazz – he's not a starter, and he sure as hell isn't a SG. Hell, I'd put him as a PF in a small lineup before I shoved him at the 2. 

He's also better off as a wrecking ball off the bench, someone you throw in for 5-10 minutes at a time and let him be a pain in the other team's behind while throwing elbows and crashing the boards on offense."
"If he's smart, he'd give up coaching because his time is way better served being a general manager – not worrying about day-to-day coaching crap. The team will be better if one guy isn't relied on to do everything that comes with both jobs. "
"an Injury free productive season of growth.  I would love a 12/6 Hustle AB off the bench.

As is, an almost unknown that also costs us quite a hefty coin."
"I would feel pretty good."
"I disagree, and with your same logic, it sounds like you'd want me to play over Bennett too, as long as I try really hard. "
"So you'd take Bennett, who has more natural skill but less confidence and work ethic over Payne who has less natural skill but shows the confidence and work ethic to get better? My main point was that I could see Payne improving, I think unless Bennett has some huge awakening we've already seen what he can do. "
"No, confidence is really important as we saw with Payne who kept trying versus Bennett who gave up multiple times. Btw, I'd take you over Bennett."
"ALLA"
"Maybe if Zoidberg is coaching, but at at our current position we'd either have to trade a draft pick or cut a current player on our roster to make it happen. "
"[deleted]"
"I would rather have Ron Adams. As good a defensive coach as Thibs, can't be worse at in-game adjustments or player management."
"Does anyone know what happened to that like a sir Corey Brewer gif that was posted in /r/nba a few days ago?"
"Well he has developed multiple fringe NBAers into meaningful contributors, so there's that"
"WHAT DO WE WANT?

*Hoiberg!*

WHEN DO WE WANT HIM?

*Relatively soon after his contract expires!*

WHAT DO WE WANT?"
"It hurts me to say this but I truly believe he will never reach his ceiling due to injuries. If he suffers another lingering injury next year I think we have to cut ties or go in another direction. He's my one of my favorite players to watch but we can't keep holding out and hoping he can stay healthy. "
"Then don't frequent a subreddit that solely discusses a team that just got a potential game-changing first overall pick in a draft that has two relatively equal prospects at a position of need at the top.

Or post something else, other than stuff like this.

There has been a lot of posts about a potential coach, but that and the draft are the main things going on right now and they are honestly more than a lot of teams have to discuss early in the offseason. 

Sorry, I guess this was kind of my ""stop posting 'stop posting about Towns/Okafor' posts."" Post post post. "
"Damn that's interesting. I did hear however that he kept saying he wants two way players and that towns is the best two way player which made me think he's taking towns."
"&gt; I'm surprised at Towns' relative lack of proficiency in help defense considering his agility and length. Maybe he tends to gamble for blocks

That worries me quite a bit. That's exactly the problem Dieng has on defense."
"This one.  I was only on the ESPN one before until they shut it down, but since I've only used the Twolves Reddit page."
"Seems like not that many people post around here, was just wondering if there was like a really popular one i'm missing"
"[This one?](http://www.canishoopus.com/)"
"Yup, that's the one."
"He was such a great energy guy for them. I'm sort of sad we don't have him anymore, but I understand why we traded him. "
"I used to post a lot on the espn boards.  A poster made a [board](http://minnesotasports.enjin.com/mobile/forum/viewforum/m/15059925/id/2840177) that a group moved to.  It never really clicked with me,  but if it's the same core they weren't bad posters.

 Lipoli390 is a poster worth keeping an eye on if I remember right. Season ticket holder so he gives good game recaps (things like Darko ignoring coaches huddles and waving to family game in and out)  and sometimes drops tidbits like he knows someone in the organization. Probably more of an optimist

AbeVigodaLive is more grounded and cynical of the franchise,  but he's another good poster if you want to counterbalance any kool-aid drinkers.

Looking at it now there's a lot of familiar names and recent posts so I think it'd be worth checking out.  I might need to dust off my username... foye2smith 

Shut up!  Randy Foye and Craig Smith are the future! "
"Sadly to say that his mental state may never change, he's basically a product of his childhood. I've known him since I played basketball with him in the 6th grade, he bounced around homes and that usually breaks anyone as a kid. I hope nothing but the best for him no matter what. "

"Warriors are favored, I think the Cavs get this one in 6 or 7 personally."
"I don't know why, but I just don't like the Warriors. I'm pulling for the Cavs."
"Mid first round picks earn over a million dollars the first year. That's a lot of incentive to go pro early. "
"I like the Warriors both as a team and an organization, but LeBron as a player. I'll be happy with this no matter who wins. "
"Flip will go one more season at least. Let's pretend we live in a good universe and the Wolves draft Towns and we win 40 games next year. There's no way Flip leaves with a team on the cusp of being something serious. Oh sure he regularly reports that he's ""interviewing"" people. But if he suddenly had the chance to be a contender? No fucking way he leaves that one last sliver of hope as a head coach.

Common shared this sentiment a week or so ago on KFAN and I think it's dead on. That's why I wouldn't get excited about TT headed here."
"Cavs.

For some reason I hate how people rag on them for the Love-Wiggins trade.


We got ourselves what we wanted with a franchise player so I think it's fair that they get their title.



Plus, Im a fan of Shump."
"&gt; He still went tops in a draft and was a major part (albeit definitely less so than Wiggins) of the Love trade. 

He was ""a major part"" of the Love trade in that we had to take him off Cleveland's hands in order for the salaries of a Love-For-Wiggins swap to balance.   You make it sound like Flip and Glen were pounding the table and insisting that AB be thrown in to the deal.  It's quite the opposite.  We were forced to take him in order to make the deal work.

Any productivity he surprises us with is pure bonus on what was already a good trade."
"Cavs, because of LeBron."
"Warriors. I always pull for the team that was built through the draft, not free agency/trades. "

"This one is the best I've found. Reddit is popular, but not super popular among some of the more annoying types of people you'd find on a common forum. Not nearly as many young kids or unacknowledged people. It's not to say that there aren't people like that here, just less than most other places I've found. Keep in mind we are in the peak of the off-season so it's a lot more active closer to and during the season. "

"I can't watch because I'm at work, but I really enjoy this channel's NBA highlights."

"Canis Hoopus is probably the most active Wolves blog/ forum. It's a community that definitely has kind of a hive-mind, but they post good stuff and welcome new people."
"Same here, I think I just hate seeing Steph Curry carrying a team to a championship not named the Timberwolves. I would also love to see Love win a championship even though he had nothing to contribute to it."

"This. I wouldn't be upset if the Warriors won because they're a great team and are fun to watch, but I can't root against LeBron"
"I like the way the play both offense and defense, and like the way the team was built to a large degree. I'm rooting for them all the way. 

I don't like the way LBJ handled himself with the return to Cleveland, how he handles this coach (and his coach in Miami the first season), the dysfunctional manner of the team, the sense of entitlement that pervades everything Cleveland and LBJ have done this year. Total turnoff. "
"I find the forums at [ProSportsDaily](http://forums.prosportsdaily.com/forumdisplay.php?59-Minnesota-Timberwolves) to be pretty top notch.  Better than here IMHO"
"It's not even bad right now. There's a lot of buzz following the draft lottery and should stay somewhat active leading into the draft in June.

After the post-draft buzz dies down, the real dead zone will be July through October. Hopefully there's a trade, coach signing, or some similar type of news then to keep us from complete offseason withdrawl."

"All 3 of them were. Super fun guys. "
"Please, a coach.  But don't wait 'till July."
"Cavs because I want Love to get a ring on the bench, not feeling like he contributed anything."
"I am a very bitter person, so I am rooting for the Cavs so KL can see how worthless he is."
"I could see towns being the 6th man for the 5 and 4 but get most of his minutes at the 4 while pek and dieng split the 5"
"I'm pulling for the Cavs just because I feel like if they win, Kevin Love might not go back and Lebron wouldn't feel bad about it. They traded Wiggins to win a championship, if they win, that trade is justifiable for LeBron but fans probably won't get that. Would love to see Love stay but I doubt he will if they win. LA Lakers here he comes!"
"This one.  I liked ESPN / Enjin / RealGM in the past, but they are all full of epeen egotards who bitch and converse about the same thing over and over again.

Best part of RealGM - All sports fans in one place.  A lot of Foreigners with great insight not only on our team, but about the Euroleague as well.

Best part about Enjin - Posters - Liploli, Camden, Abe etc

Best part about Rubechat - a poster or two in a sea of filth.

"I'm Routing for GSW in a 4-0 Sweep.  
I'm also routing for Kevin Love, but he's not going to be playing so...
I also am a LaBJ hater."
"I hate the Cavs organization. Dan Gilbert is garbage. They were handed insurmountable luck which led to them landing the best player in the league. The team was built through free agency instead of the draft, and they did so by taking our unhappy guy who left us in order to win a championship.

On the other hand, I love watching the best. LeBron is the best and he's proving it in these playoffs. Love is out, Kyrie is banged up, and LeBron has it going on all cylinders. He's proving right now that he can lead a team and doesn't need a crutch in teammates like Wade/Bosh.

I'm also bitter that Love left us to join the best team. I always have a place in my heart for franchise players who stick with one team. Despite the fact that our FO certainly didn't make great moves while he was here and I entirely understand why he left, I'm still bitter. I don't want him to be an NBA champion (*especially if he's not even playing*).

If Love is going to win the championship, I want him to be a big part of it and *prove* that he really is that good. Him getting carried to an NBA championship this year is disgusting and just goes to prove that he's not the caliber of player he thinks he is.

As much as I like seeing LeBron cement his legacy (and give Cleveland a reason to celebrate for the first time ever), there are too many negatives surrounding the Cavs and Love for me to root for them.

On the flip side, I like everyone associated with the Warriors (although I'm a little Lukewarm on Dray)."
"JVG is a great option for us. Still cannot believe how ignorant Flip is being towards some great coaching candidates this year, especially since the whole K Love situation is far behind us. I don't have a good feeling about this."
"I have been very skeptical about Thibs being even remotely interested in the Wolves job, but there was a guy on KFAN yesterday with Barreiro that actually was getting me hyped about the possibility that Thibs may even be interested in the job."
"Good. I don't want him. "
"In that case it wouldn't be good, the article says he isn't ruling us out"
"Likes flip, likes wiggins, coaches defense. Had a bad relationship with the bat shit crazy Chicago ownership, yeah I'll take him.  "
"My only issue with thibs is that he overplays guys and doesn't give them enough rest. Otherwise he's great"
"Cavs because I want Kevin Love to watch his team win it all from the bench"
"Flip's the same way though. I like Thibs, would prefer Hoiberg."
"I don't understand why people have an issue with this when Flip had wiggins playing top 10 minutes in the league..."
"Has anyone been arguing this lately? 

Our starting 5 will be either Towns or Okafor. The first overall pick doesn't come off the bench on a 16 win team."
"I don't want Thibs, but hear me out first. 

I don't think he's going to give the patience to develop our young guys that aren't a guaranteed success such as LaVine, Muhammad, and Dieng. I'm afraid that he'll put too much pressure and play Wiggins too much which will shorten his career ala Derek Rose. I think he'll run our top prospects into the ground and won't give our ""high ceiling"" guys a chance to prove themselves. Plus, I don't see any good reason to take the development of our young guys out of Flip's hands until we are at least a playoff chasing team.  "
"Top 2 in minutes, iirc.



But with that being said, he averaged 41mpg.  Honestly, a lot of superstars averaged around 40mpg in the early half of their career.


I think it's a bit of a concern but not quite as big of a deal as everyone makes it out to be.


This year just happened to have an unusual amount of injuries so everyone is paranoid."
"Definitely Canis"
"In regards to the 5, I am of the belief that Towns is a future 4, he can knock down jumpers consistently and has a promising free throw percentage to highlight his potential at the 4. I would rather have a starting 5 of Rubio-Martin-Wiggins-KG-Towns to have a great defensive frontline, but if we were to not start KG or Towns, I don't see how anyone could still be arguing for Pek over Dieng at this point."
"You have valid points. On the flip side (no Flip Saunders pun intended), Thibs has consistently gotten the best out of almost all of the players he has coached. He is the reason guys like Nate Robinson and DJ Augustine got paid after leaving Chicago and then proceeded to be bit players on teams they moved on to.  
  
I can't speak on his development of players at all, but all I do know is that guys that weren't great players before he got there all of the sudden became at the very least critical role players on winning teams."
"Obviously I can't prove either way either, but as far as I know there definitely is no science behind guys getting hurt more often because of how Thibs coached his teams. For all we know, those injuries could have happened anyway."
"Thibs would be a good get for the Wolves, he's a way better coach than Flip. He's also had success in Chicago in developing good defenders and made Butler from the last pick in the first round into an All-Star.   

  
Not that credentials or fit matter though since Flip has no interest in finding another coach at this time. Flip hasn't even gone after Hoiberg this year who at one point was on the list of potential gets a year ago, [Hoiberg would have listened if the Wolves would have called](https://twitter.com/brittrobson/status/604037052305383424). "
"&gt; I can't speak on his development of players at all

He developed Noah into a DPOY, Rose into an MVP, and Butler into an MIP and All-Star. "
"You can argue that Gorgui should start over Pek for a number of reasons. You mention health, and I think that's a good point - having continuity in the starting five would be really valuable. Gorgui also might be a better fit offensively with some groups, since he can stretch the floor a bit from the five, but assuming we have a player like KG, Bjelica, or Towns at the PF position that skill is not a necessity from the center spot.

But arguing that Gorgui is a better player, I disagree with. I think Pek will get healthy again. He had surgery to remove the tissue that was supposed to be causing a lot of his soreness. And when healthy, Pek averaged 17 points and 9 rebounds with a PER over 20. Those are numbers that G hasn't put up, and likely never will.

He's got a quality post game with a number of moves on each block and he's effective with either hand. He sets very good, hard screens, which opens up the offense in ways that people don't appreciate. I don't know if there is an advanced stat that shows screen setting, but the team gets a lot more open looks when Pek is on the court than when he is off it. One area of offense where Gorgui really struggles is hitting his picks, which makes it difficult for guys to find space to catch and shoot or catch and drive. Pek is also a good roll man in high ball screen pick and roll, by far the best on the team, which should be a core action on a team with Ricky Rubio running point. Another one of Gorgui's weaknesses is his very high turnover rate (I believe he led the league in traveling violations this year) which we don't have to worry about with Pek. They have different strengths and weaknesses on defense, but I would argue have the same net impact on that end. Pek also brings a huge amount of physicality to the squad. He's willing to hit guys and absorb the retaliation and getting hit back that comes with that. That's valuable.

[Assuming he gets healthy again next year, Pekovic will be the better player. He's done it before.](http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;sum=0&amp;y1=2014&amp;p1=pekovni01&amp;y2=2015&amp;p2=dienggo01&amp;p3=&amp;p4=&amp;p5=&amp;p6=)"
"I'm right here with you. "
"I respect your opinion. I agree with Pek being better in P&amp;R currently. You bring up the 17 and 9 that Pek averaged before his slew of injuries. My question to you is would you agree that those numbers are pretty inflated considering we had K Love that season, a top 5 player in the league that year? Pek's defender was rarely given help due to Love's ability to stretch the floor, something Gorgui has never had. I will bring up that when Pek was injured a while back, this might have been two seasons ago, but Gorgui really came into his own offensively and had some 20 and 10 games that highlighted what he could do. Now, I am not saying he is a 20 and 10 guy because he never will be, but he can be effective on the other end. The reason I think Gorgui is better on defense is because of his length. I know he's not a great defender, but he can still block shots and more importantly alters way more shots than Pek. You cannot argue that. And while you bring up ""I believe Pek will be healthy next year"", with good points about his injury, it is hard for me to think for one second that he will ever be able to put together a healthy season ever again. I'm not one for hypotheticals, and the truth lies within the facts. He hasn't been able to stay healthy since earning that huge contract, which I truly believe was a bi-product of him playing alongside the best stretch power forward and fringe MVP candidate that year in K Love."
"Oh my.  Canis.  It is a dark, depressing place.

There are a few smart basketball minds that frequent that site.  The problem with the community is the prevalent, unrelenting pessimism.  I understand how longtime Wolves fans might not have the most cheery outlook for this team, but the point of watching sports is enjoyment and that community sucks all of the joy out being a fan.

Few people on that site are as smart as they think they are and the ones that are, aren't as funny as they think."
"The Pek of two years ago, I'd say you were wrong.

But Jesus, how many 8-foot lazy not-quite-hook-shot attempts does a guy have to clang off the rim before it becomes obvious that he can't jump, can't back up his man, and DOESN'T have the footwork he was once so highly praised for.  Is his body breaking down or does he just not care as much?  Does it matter which one it is?

He still has value at taking up space in the paint and boxing out for rebounds, but far less than he used to.

As for post scoring:  We're gonna have either Towns or Okafor next year.  Plus we'll have Bazz back.  Post scoring is one thing that the Wolves will not be short of with or without Pek."
"Towns is enough of a 4-5 tweener that I'd be cool with seeing him and Dieng on the floor together.

If it's Okafor that gets taken, then yeah he's the center and Dieng will have to either learn to be effective as a PF or else come off the bench."
"The team has not made the playoffs in 11 years, in a league where more than half the teams make playoffs. The fact that they are in a pessimistic rut is understandable, to say the least. 

Canis is definitely not for everyone- they are often rude and harsh to people who post uninformed or trolling comments, which can be annoying but that's how it is. Like I said, they have a hive-mind, and people who don't agree can be batted around. 

That site holds some of the greatest Wolves fan basketball minds out there, and it can be a treat to see some of the stuff they post. Also, I get a solid 10 or so laughs every time I read the comments. "
"Not wanting to coach New Orleans because Anthony Davis might leave is the dumbest reasoning I think you could come up with.  Like he's not going to get the Rose max? So he's not going to take the job cause Davis may try to wiggle his way out in the 4th year of his 5 year extension? And it's not like New Orleans would fire Thibs upon Davis leaving.  What coach is banking on anything happening or not happening five years down the road?  "

"I think some of those guys were going to be very good no matter what, but Thibs hates having to trust his rookies and younger projects. Ask Bulls fans about Thibs treatment of Snell. LaVine would constantly be benched because Zach is highly mistake prone and Thibs just wouldn't stand for it. 

Overall I think he'd kill this teams chance to reach its ultimate peak to win more games in the next few seasons. "
"I think him not hiring someone at this time is more beneficial."
"So Thibs just wants to be unemployed? Fuck, it looks like every coaching vacancy isn't good enough for him for some reason or another."
"I actually do too. Unless it's Hoiberg, we're still in a developmental stage. Let's bet the best coach we can, not just nab one because we're desperate. "
"Nah.  I'll be pissed next off-season but with KG coming back for presumably one more swan song, I think it was his understanding he'd be playing for Flip.  As bad of an in-game coach as Flip is, I can't complain that he will play the young guys a lot more than perhaps a better coach would.  Flip's not worried about getting fired, but a new coach would tend to focus more on winning than development.   We obviously want to accomplish both, but I'll take one more ""down year"" in order to see LaVine, Wiggins, Bazz get more reps on the court.  There's really not that enticing of coaches out there either IMO.  Thibs is great but not a good fit unless he'd settle for defensive coordinator lol.  Hoiberg would be the home-run but sounds like he's a lock for the Bulls.  I weirdly wouldn't mind Jeff Van Gundy but no way he comes here.  

I have a sneaky suspicion that Tom Izzo may be a dark horse candidate for 2016.  He flirted with Cleveland a few years back and if Billy Donovan succeeds in OKC, I could see Izzo getting an itch to try his hand.  What better place than with his buddy Flip as boss and a talent-laden young squad."
"1. I think Thibs is looking to take  1 year off.

2. I also think Flip doesn't want to give up the job, at least this year."

"It's pretty bad. Wolves miss out on Hoiberg who would be interested. Everyone saying that another coach would sacrifice development for wins is ridiculous. In the hiring process Flip can set the organizational expectations and inform the coach that development should be the primary goal for at least the first season. Any coach interested in the Wolves job would understand that. Look at how Boston handled the Stevens hire.  

"
"So we agree on everything except the hilarity of the boards.

And as smart as the users are, they can really out-think themselves sometimes.  Early in the season, for example, there were MULTIPLE regulars arguing how the Wolves would benefit from trading Wiggins for Otto Fucking Porter.  That was the day that I quit going to that site."

"I think even if Thibs wanted the job, Flip would still roll with himself as coach. "
"Flip and the coaching staff did a great job developing Wiggins this year. I'm confident they can do the same with this year's pick. "
"No i am not because it seems to me that your POW is entirely a fan constructed narrative. Ofcourse we're not getting Donovan when the other option's got 2 top 10 players on the roster and i don't really care much about Skiles.

I know he was very active before last season and i haven't seen anything to suggest he isn't searching for valid candidates this offseason."
"&gt; As bad of an in-game coach as Flip is

I don't know how this idea were invented, but Flip is at the very least an average in-game coach and the way i see it he seems a bit above average."
"It depends on the coach that we're after. If they've been talking with Hoiberg and there's a good chance that he would do it next season, I understand holding off a bit. There's no rush for this season since it will mostly be dedicated to developing young talent which Flip is pretty good at.

The shameful part is if Thibs or some other big time coach has interest in coming here but we're not able to lock them up at this time. I'm not too rushed to find someone this season, but if the best candidate is out there and willing, then we should jump on it."
"Wolves were the worst team out of timeouts this season. He runs a bad offense in today's NBA and has always been a bad defensive coach. "
"Let's remember Thibs isn't directly speaking here. It might be bs."

"They were also the most inexperienced and least talented teams out of timeouts. From what i've seen he's running more plays than a lot of teams and most of the plays are kinda the same as what everyone else runs.

Sure he's no Pop, but he's no Vinny de la Negro either."
"Doesn't surprise me, but doesn't bother me either. We got time for the right coach to come up. "
"True,  I still don't buy it as a valid concern I think it is floated cause of polar opposite thoughts.  Either NOP wasn't as in love with Thibs as assumed and he's saving face or Thibs wants the gig, but he's trying to pry open the pocket book a bit more.

  I don't buy that an unemployed coach isn't interested in coaching hands down the best player out of the available gigs. "

"They are not the same plays everyone else runs. Other teams will run plays for 3 pointers, Flip runs action to get long 2s. Other teams will run pick and roll action space the floor.

I don't understand the hate for the Warriors. They literally have only been successful for like 2 year here, and immediately people start hating them? I honestly believe that people are just sick of hearing about them, so they associate that with ""hating"" them. They are such a fun team to watch when they are clicking.

Like you said, I love watching the best. LeBron, another person everyone hates i guess, can take on any team when he is ""on"". 

So, I guess I'm rooting for the guys that everyone hates. 

P.S. Fuck Kevin Love"
"With Flip already liking what he saw from Okafor during the season, seeing a more agile/quick player who's lighter on his feet could cause some controversy. We'll have to wait and see as Zgoda would say!"
"Hopefully it means he blesses us with a NBA championship in the future. TYBASEDGOD"
"it's not uncommon for guys projected to go at the very top of the draft to not workout because really all they can do is lower their stock.  Towns is the #1 or #2 by such a huge margin that having a good workout does him no good but having a bad one could lower him below Russell, Muiday, etc if they have good ones."
"I like LeBron...

...but I dislike Love.

I want Kevin Love to get a humiliating championship ring even though he didn't earn it...

...but just the thought of him being carried to a free ring is hard to stomach.

So I guess I'm rooting for the Cavs, but only for LeBron's sake."
"I like how this is becoming a legitimate thing haha"
"If we dont trade both picks, which I think we will.  You would only want to draft one of them.  There skill sets are similar enough that you wouldnt draft both of them.  I might take a swing at one because they can play in crunch time.  There are just alot of players better then them in this draft, its pretty deep.  I dont think you have to trade up to get both.  However, I think you use the two picks to trade up since it would be tough to get 2 second rounders to make the roster, as well as its getting the most value for them.  "

"Most of the advanced metrics say that Towns is the superior player.  Not sure why you'd be OK with Okafor given that fact..."
"If a Flip drafts Okafor #1, then he's a bigger idiot than I imagined.  Which says something considering he gave up the Miami first for 3 months of Thad Young and gave up another first for Payne (who was arguably the worst PF in the NBA last year.  "
"I would only keep the seconds if we can get high potential guys at positions of need.

We're super young and we don't need three more rookies this draft. I'd like to trade them for future picks."
"Flip's exit from this team can't come soon enough. At least we have another top 5 lottery pick coming next year. Can you imagine four consecutive #1 picks on the same team? "
"😓"
"That Chicago was more attractive for Hoiberg than Minnesota. He gets to coach a playoff ready team straight away, doesn't have to go through the development stage which is one of the hardest things for a new coach to go through.

I know that Flip is an average game coach, but personally I saw enough improvement out of Wiggins, LaVine and Shabazz this season to trust him to continue to develop this very young team.

So I am fine with Flip coaching this team for one or two more seasons, by than we will a much more attractive team and every season there are one or two really good coaches available. 

What I do not want is what Orlando is going through where the coaching situation is so unstable. "
"Is anyone actually suprised by this? Fred Hoiberg has been very connected to the Chicago Bulls org for a long, long time."
"Hoiberg has a bigger connection with the Wolves. The problem isn't that Hoiberg chose Chicago, the problem is the Wolves never gave him the option to choose between the Wolves and Chicago because Flip has installed himself as the permanent head coach. "
"I would take not having a coach to be in the east with this roster"
"That we were almost certainly never in the running. Hoiberg was going to Chicago the whole way, and nothing Flip said or did would have changed that.

"I actually don't think this year is anywhere close to the most enticing situation the Wolves will have going forward. Yes, we have Wiggins and the #1, but we also just had the worst record in the NBA and basically our whole roster is either bad, unproven, or injury prone.

Give us another year of Developing Bazz, Lavine, Wiggins, Dieng and #1, and a more competent finish along with another high lottery pick, and I think it will attract a good coach."
"I'm sure he would have interviewed with the Wolves out of professional respect and admiration for Flip, but as of right now the Bulls are just a more attractive option for an up and coming head coach.

The Wolves have a ton of potential, but are totally unproven. That's a hard place to start as a first head coaching job in the NBA. The Bulls are a veteran playoff team that also has a couple really good young players to build off of going forward, and are in by far the easier conference. 

Give the Wolves another year or two to develop our young guys and prove we can compete in the West and I think we can attract top level coaching prospects like Hoiberg."
"Even if Flip offered the job to him and he had to choose between Chicago and Minnesota. He'd take the Bulls job. Anyone would.

You can't put past his ties to Chicago though. Gar Forman even bought his house a while back."
"How isn't a team that has the rookie of the year and this year's #1 pick not more attractive than Chicago who just ran out one of the best head coaches in the league. The Wolves are an easy place to start as a first head coach, their young and will listen to you. Very low expectations right out of the gate. In Chicago it's championship or bust.   

The Wolves should be able to attract top coaching talent now except Flip Saunders won't give up the position. "
"On one hand, you've got a team that was the 3 seed.

On the other, you've got the worst team in the NBA last year.

Just because we didn't get him doesn't mean that Flip didn't try.

You people..."
"If he would have been given the choice between the two and chose Chicago fine. That's not a problem the fact he wasn't given the choice is a huge issue, it means any idea that Flip's tenure as head coach would be short is bullshit. He's not looking for a replacement anymore we're stuck with him and that's really bad because he isn't a good coach anymore.   

Also I'm not sure given the option Hoiberg would choose Chicago over Minnesota. Minnesota has Wiggins which we know he is a fan of, plus the #1 pick, and a young core of guys that has potential to be very good for a very long time. Plus Hoiberg is familiar with Flip and is part of the Glen Taylor country club. "
"If Flip did try Wolfson and Zgoda would have been all over it. Flip didn't because Flip wants to coach the Wolves, which is a huge problem. "
"The Bulls made the playoffs last year and the Wolves had the worst record in the league. If you want to win games and contend for championships (which I assume Hoiberg wants to do), right now the Bulls are a vastly better option for a coach.

Even assuming all of our young guys pan out we're still probably 2 years away at minimum from making the playoffs at all, let alone contending. 


"
"I can already tell what's going to happen:

Some time within the next year, a report will come out that details how much Flip pursued Hoiberg and it was kept quiet from the media, because nothing good ever comes from sharing stuff with them.  A link will be posted here where it will receive 5 upvotes and be read by almost nobody.  A month or two later, another top tier coach will lose his job and the cycle will repeat itself."
"Thank you.

The Harrison's are awful.  No thank you to either of them, even if they go undrafted.  If they're chucks in college on an All-Star team, they'll be chucks in the NBA as well."
"Here's a far more likely scenario: nothing ever comes out because nothing ever happened, and Flip Saunders continues to coach the team unabated even though he flat out doesn't have the track record to deserve this level of organizational power. 

The guy's doing what he loves and is his own boss. Who the hell would ever fire themselves from that? If we win ~30 games next year that be used as a reason for why he deserves to keep the job long-term. This plan has been visible from the first day he returned as GM and for some reason people refuse to open their eyes."
"Jason Kidd jumped ship from a playoff team in the Nets to the Bucks who had the worst record in the league last season. Brad Stevens went from perennial March Madness team Butler to the Celtics who had just initiated their rebuild. Bad teams can get good/great coaches over better teams. Hoiberg may have gone to the Wolves given the opportunity, we know he's a huge fan of Wiggins, but he wasn't given the opportunity because of Flip's stranglehold of the Timberwolves franchise.  "
"Neither of them are good enough to trade up to take them. A guy that I've seen in the mid 20s that I wouldn't mind taking a shot at is Rashad Vaughn. I know it's a log jam at the 2/3 spots but I think he could develop to be pretty good down the road, and with the 31st pick that's what you're kinda hoping for. "
"Why would Flip keep going after Hoiberg a secret? He's the guy everyone wants. Flip didn't go after him, and he's not going after anyone else.   

A guy doesn't say [""I'm the coach until I say I'm not"" and ""I'll coach until I feel we need to move in a different direction,""](http://www.nba.com/2015/news/04/20/flip-saunders-wolves.ap/) before he starts conducting hiring interviews. "
"Who really knows? Flip might just want to try for an healthier mulligan on last season. If the OP tweet is true he sure didn't give Flip a lot of time to offer before choosing Chicago. You could be completely right in assuming Flip's never offered but then again you aren't Flip or Fred. ^^or ^^maybe ^^you ^^are?

And let's be honest KG didn't say he's retiring yet, and If KG is coming back Flip Saunders has to be the head coach. As long as our young guys keep improving (so far, so good) then I'm fine with Flip coaching for now. Let's panic next season when/if they get worse."
"You guys read far too much Bill Simmons and put too much weight into clickbait tweets.  Flip is no Czar, despite tweets to the contrary, every time he has to explain something to Payne or LaVine, he looks like he would rather jump off the IDS Tower.  Coaching is actually the biggest, biggest bitch in the world.

I turned down a ton of paid positions to coach over the last year because it's so much more fun to evaluate talent and leave it to somebody else to do the brain-cell-decimating work of repeating the same thing hundreds of times.  The people who tweet about how much ""fun"" Flip is having have obviously never coached a day in their lives, especially not a team that is in rebuilding.

Hoiberg was the only coach worth pursuing among this year's free agent coaches (no thank you to Thibs).  He signed with a contender.  Now every Chicken Little is having a field day.  The guy is 60.  He doesn't want to be out there for longer than he has to, but frankly I'm happy he's bearing that cross because he's doing wonders with our young guys.  Everybody loves to assume that would've happened with anybody else coaching, but if you would've told this sub in December that Zach would have a 37-point game against the number 1 defense in the league, we would be shitting our pants.  If you credit anybody other than Flip for Zach's development, you need a little more mental development yourself.  I'm more than happy to throw away another year for 30 wins if it means that Flip keeps instilling the right mentality into our young players."
"What does Flip have to gain from telling the media?  If we were to land Hoiberg, we would've been stealing him from the far more appealing Bulls.  It's usually nor wise for underdogs to announce their plans for the entire world to hear.

And what's wrong with saying that?  Is what he is saying incorrect?  If there was somebody out there who was a good hire who wanted to come here, we would have him.

This subreddit is getting delusional.  Just because there's a ton of free agent coaches doesn't mean that they're not they're good coaches.  The Magic just signed Scotty Skilles!!  That's the next best guy on the market behind Holberg!  Signing a coach now would mean locking into multiple years or stunted growth because NBA coaches are all almost uniformly concerned with winning as many games right now.  We have a coach who is developing our players the correct way and it's costing us wins, and people are mad about that..?

I will trust in Flip until I am given a reason not to.  I like what I'm seeing out of him.  Anecdotal evidence does not sway me away from the big picture—our young guys that we started the year with are all preforming above expectations."
"What a stupid thing to expect.  A coaching vacancy normally means anything other than stable.  It's a sign of a poor coach if he doesn't think he can coach a team that has a bright future."
"Flip should have been trying to get Hoiberg since the Wolves got bounced out of the playoffs, if he wanted him at all. Chicago's job has been open for less than a week. Flip had ample enough time to contact Hoiberg or any other available coach.  

&gt; If there was somebody out there who was a good hire who wanted to come here, we would have him.  

No we wouldn't because Flip isn't giving up the job. 

Flip isn't developing players to be successful in today's NBA he's developing players to fit his system, which coincidentally is an awful broken outdated system. Flip convinced Wiggins to abandon the 3 point shot, how is that good development?    

Also Flip tried to win as many games as possible this last season, he went all in to win games at the start of the season. It wasn't until injuries destroyed the season that he had the bright idea to rebuild.   

The delusion is the other way, the majority of this sub believes Flip is an infallible savior. Everything he's done is amazing. Despite the Wolves in actuality being entirely awful. [Regarding Flip this is what the majority of the sub looks like](http://i.imgur.com/EWEmaDd.png).   

Bottom line is Flip is supposed to be doing what's best for the organization but the only thing he's ever done is do what's best for himself. "
"The Chicago job opening up was a formality, everybody knew this would probably be Thibs last year in December.  Holberg would've been a moron to sign with the Wolves straight-away—Every NBA team is trying to find the next Brad Stevens, and he has been an attractive candidate for some time.

I will make a gentleman's bet with you that Flip isn't the coach at the start of the 2017 season.  Unless the team is winning or another good option hasn't arisen, I'll be happy to concede I was wrong if he's still coaching at that time.

I really don't think his system is outdated.  He's teaching Wiggins like he's a young Jordan or Kobe.  The post game, the midrange game, correct footwork and a fearless attacking mentality.  The NBA has gone analytics crazy, and well past the equilibrium.  In 3 years, Wiggins and Shabazz might be the only good wing players who have a post game in their arsenal.  What defender is going to be able to stop that?

The dream of Wiggins being a Harden-esque player is that, a dream.  They're cut from completely different cloth.  I would rather have Wiggins catching the ball at 16 feet than 24—He's two strides closer to the rim which gives the help defense two strides less time to react when he attacks.  When you play basketball checkers the numbers supports run-and-gun 3's-and-layups.  When you play basketball chess, with an intimate knowledge of footwork, angles, and counters, I would prefer a player catches the ball as close to the rim as possible.  We might have the next transcendent player, why are we screaming that he should be emulating Wesley Matthews?

I mean, before Rubio went down, we didn't look that bad.  Not to mention, our young guys were not ready to handle the weight we put on them later in the season on Day 1.  I don't blame him for being conservative with them because they definitely weren't ready.

I don't see any stuff praising Flip for Zach's development shooting to the front of the page, but it seems like every week we have something reactionary shoot to the top when the answer is totally logical.

If Flip was doing what's best for Flip, he would be on a golf course in Florida.  Just because it's all of our dream jobs to be a coach, or president of basketball operations, or part owner, doesn't mean it's the most enjoyable thing he's doing.  He obviously wants to build something here.  Considering he can't draw an exact blueprint of his mind, I'm more than fine with the architect building the foundation."
"Flip is as close to a Czar as possible within a sports organization. He's part owner, president, and coach. Glen Taylor won't force Flip to do anything he doesn't want to because Glen is going to give up ownership in the next few years. 

What are you talking about? Flip loves coaching more than anything in the world, him deciding to coach the Wolves wasn't a cross to bear is was an opportunity to get back into doing what he loves. Flip was forced into brief retirement because no NBA team wanted a coach that got run out of Detroit and later Washington. As soon as he had the opportunity to get back into it he took advantage.    

"
"I would take that bet but you just gave yourself a ton of outs that are more opinion based than anything, like what's considered another good option.  

Flip's system is outdated, it overly relies on isolation scoring and deflates attempts from deep. There is no spacing and very little off the ball movement. Flip's offense is the very definition of basketball checkers it is singularly focused. One piece is the singular focus, Golden State is basketball chess multiple moves are being made and flowing simultaneously to achieve the goal of high efficiency baskets at the rim, from the foul line, and from deep.   

You ever check out Wiggins in college? He was most effective from the Harden zones. Getting to the rim, getting to the foul line, and taking and making good shots from deep. The Wes Mathews outcome is a much better outcome than him taking too many mid range jumpers doing a bad Rudy Gay impression.   

Rubio played 4 games before he went down, hardly a large enough sample size to conclude the team was going to be good.   

Flip is doing what's best for Flip he loves coaching more than anything in the world. Plus he was able to secure a sweet gig for his son, and all his old buddies.   

I'm sure you're fine with Flip. I am not fine with a guy who is the antithesis of where the NBA is going in terms of thinking, development, and evaluation. Flip is anti forward basketball progress. 

"
"&gt;  Hoiberg is familiar with Flip and is part of the Glen Taylor country club

Which is why I don't think he'll ever work for the Wolves again."
"Exactly right, he has little to gain by doing those workouts, so he won't. We'd like him to, of course, but he can only lower his own draft stock at this point. "
"70-30 in favor of Towns. Okafor's feet movement resembles that of Duncan but Wolves need a defensive player. Already Timberwolves have Rubio, a guard without J. Adding center who can neither defend nor hit free throw will make a strange roster. "
"I think Flip will ultimately draft Okafor regardless of workout results. His local connections are too deep and Wolves organization will have difficult time overriding his decision. 

I have some worry b/c Wolves already has a PG who cannot shoot. Adding C - in addition to Pekovic - who cannot defend will create a strange roster. "
"If Miami has #1 pick and plans to draft Okafor, I will not worry about the decision b/c Riley will clearly have plans. But, like you pointed out, Flip and Wolves frontoffice does not have a good history of drafts&amp;trades. 

Makes me worry when they think they know better than the general public and can outsmart the so-called media experts. Reminds me of 2009 draft."
"It also reminds me of Chris Grant and the Cavs.  He drafted Dion Waiters WAY too high and then drafted Anthony Bennett over higher ranked prospects like Nerlens Noel, Oladipo, etc.  both of those picks turned out to be disasters obviously.

Sometimes these GMs outsmart themselves and fall in love wth a lesser prospect bc of ""fit"" or some other reason.  The smart play is to draft the best prospect available and worry about everything else later.  "
"Royce is the definition of a playmaking 4, something I think teams will be looking for after the success of the Warriors with Draymond Green. I hope he can make a successful move to the NBA but it will be an uphill battle after how he handled the whole Rockets situation. "
"It'll be flip until next year at least. Most good coaches want a Team thats ready to win"
"I agree with pretty much everything you've said in this thread. The blind following of Flip is always frustrating, but this one is on a whole 'nother level. 

He didn't even make an offer to the guy who has been most of this fan base's top coaching candidate for the last 3+ years, and suddenly, most people don't care because ""In Flip we Trust."" "
"Ryan Saunders"
"Flip needs to get over himself and offer the position.  "
"It sucks that it has become popular to rip on Pek. Both Dieng and Pek are good players. Pek is slightly better on the offensive boards (Dieng is also excellent) and scores in higher volume while shooting a similar percentage. Neither is good on defense. Dieng may be slightly better on d but it isn't by much.

They're very close."
"I wonder what thibs would do with a year off.   He has no wife, no kids, no family, and seemingly no friends outside of the NBA.  With his work ethic, he's not the type of guy who will sit on his couch all day or go fishing.  Weird dude."
"Is this a serious question?  Assuming it is, CHI is a contender, plays in a much worse conference, and is a far more attractive city.  

In MN, it will be at least 2 years before playoff contention and (best case) ~3 years from being a true contender.   The best option is to lose a ton of games this season and get another blue chip prospect top 3, something no coach wants to do.  "
"I've always liked John Wgo. Defensive minded. Seems to really connect with his players."
"My best guess is Flip coaches this year, then next season we hire his best bud Tommy Izzo. "
"How can you knock a team for spending money on FAs or making trades to better their team? "
"Oh man. Those classic Wgo teams at University of State in Decade were my favorite thing about March."
"I won't be surprised when it happens"
"&gt;I saw enough improvement out of Wiggins, LaVine and Shabazz this season to trust him to continue to develop this very young team.

This is the worst argument ever to be okay with Flip continuing to coach. Every team has ""improving players."" There is very little evidence to suggest that one coach is better at developing players than another coach.

To add to that, there is no reason to think Flip is good at developing talent. Some of our young guys improved, some didn't.

If you want to go back to KG, KG became a star, but Flip couldn't develop any other young players alongside him.

Wiggins would have been good with any coach. KG would have been good with any coach. 

Players obtain skills through practice and experience. The head coach's job is to utilize those skills.

In my opinion, it would be far more beneficial for us to get a long-term coach ASAP, so Wiggins and the other players can start learning the scheme and concepts they will be playing in for the next however many years.

I think consistency at the coaching position is more important than any supposed developmental benefits from Flip coaching. "
"David Adelman. "
"&gt;  When you play basketball checkers the numbers supports run-and-gun 3's-and-layups.  When you play basketball chess, with an intimate knowledge of footwork, angles, and counters, I would prefer a player catches the ball as close to the rim as possible.  

Well ""basketball chess"" got us the worst record in the NBA, and ""basketball checkers"" got the Rockets and Warriors to the WCF.

&gt;We might have the next transcendent player, why are we screaming that he should be emulating Wesley Matthews?

This is a stupid copout. Nobody has ever suggested Wiggins emulate Wes Matthews. Adding the three to his arsenal will only help his game and the team, not hurt it."
"He gets 9 million dollars to sit out this season. If I were him, I'd wait and fill the Lakers coaching vacancy next season. "
"Plus Fred told me he might coach the Wolves one day :( This makes me so sad we never even gave him a shot..."
"This is a pretty contentious post. I think it's safe to say we ALL wanted Hoiberg..."
"Thought wgo was sitting out for the year, but I'm delighted to find out I'm wrong!!"
"Am I the only one who thinks if Flip got a good coach interested in this job he'd give up coaching immediately?"
"Not even the Pek of two years ago, though.  He's ALWAYS been a liability on defense, and his fatigue has always been an issue.  Was he a more consistent low-post scorer? Absolutely.  But the Pek of two years ago was still getting his shot blocked by guards, still not rotating on defense, and still not protecting the rim in any fashion....Pek is a great character, and he does have a nice low-post game *against certain matchups*....but his contract is outrageous and Dieng is clearly the superior option at center."
"Pelicans would say no. And pretty pointless from a wolves perspective. 

And stop trying to trade Kevin Martin!"
"I'd def take Gordon and Anderson in that scenario both are younger and roughly the same talent levels."
"This title made me wonder if we were getting a coach the Chinese league or something."
"I doubt Pelicans say yes."
"I don't understand why people say that drafting Okafor before Towns would be an idiot move, roles were reserved just a year ago who knows what will happen in the future, they are both super talented. You just got to trust people who do this for a living."
"I'm sorry, but if you think the Wolves job is more appealing than coaching the Bulls.. You are an idiot. "
"I don't really want Gordon. We're always linked to his name, but he's just someone I don't want. However, I think Anderson is a good fit. Stretch 4 that isn't a bitch (Cough Cough, Kevin Love)."
"IIRC Byron is on 4year deal with last year as team option, so we won't have a coaching vacancy unless we fire the guy. If you drafted Towns and got Thibs to teach him and Wiggins defense it would be very interesting, obviously you  are still missing couple pieces to compete in the West."
"Damn it"
"Almost every advanced metric points to Towns being a (far) superior prospect than Okafor.  You take BPA when you're as bad as MN, that's a fact.  

""Trust people who do this for a living"" - another one of the dumber things I've heard recently.  Should fans have trusted Flip during the Thad Young and Payne trades?  Both trades were laughed at at the time and now, a few months later, each trade was an abject failure.   

How about when Kahn was doing this for a living - did he deserve trust?  Or when the Cavs drafted Anthony Bennett and Waiters?  If you think GMs are infallible, then you must be new to sports."
"Well 2013 draft was pretty weak, they didn't passed on any projected superstar anyway who was projected first pick Oladipo?  
And I would call a GM an idiot only if he take anyone else than Towns/Okafor, I don't think that any of them will be a bust."
"Nerlens, Oladipo, or Len were projected well above Bennett.  In fact, Bennett is headed to being the biggest bust ever, so yeah - trusting the GM didn't work out there.  Bennett would've likely fallen out of the top 10 had CLE not taken him first.  

Dude, with the #1 pick, you're not trying to avoid a bust - you're trying to draft a superstar.  As I said already, the experts and the advanced stats both point to Towns as being the superior prospect.  If a GM picks an inferior prospect, then he's an idiot (not to mention the other dumb moves he's made).  This is pretty simple stuff bro.  "
"If I'm the Wolves GM:  Absoutlely.  One summer of our books being clogged when we shouldn't even be attempting tons sign free agents to get rid of Pek and Martin?  Where do I sign?

I could probably flip Gordon and Anderson in trades at the deadline for some small assets too.

If I'm the Pelicans GM:  Hell no.  I'm balls deep with this team ever since the Jrue and Tyreke trades.  I can't be giving away 2 of my 5 best players, even if they only have a year left on their contracts, especially if the players I'm getting back aren't great."
"I would say no. "
"KAT is not Wig's buddy pal"
"I LOVE Ryan Anderson and would kill for that deal. Eric Gordon is injury prone garbage, much like Pek, but at least we have depth and options at the 2 (Lavine, Wiggins &amp; Shabazz occasionally)"
"If I was the Pelicans GM I would say no."
"that step back against harden at 2:15 is absolutely filthy. "
"I would pull the trigger on that so fast, based on age and contracts"

"Man I love shabazz. My favorite wolf for sure. Love how hard he works and can't wait for a full, healthy season from him. He absolutely went out and earned his playing time and I respect the hell out of that. Practically forced Adelman and then Flip to give him quality minutes. "
"Well, it's kind of a combination. Players will naturally develop if they're driven. Wiggins, LaVine and Shabazz all seem to be motivated that way.

BUT a good coach will maximize the skills they do have, and the skills they're working to improve. That's what I get frustrated with watching Flip's coaching. Just having LaVine play the PG because ""Why not, we're trying to lose"" isn't really a thought-out coaching decision. If his future is at the 2, let's have him get used to playing there and defending 2s.

Or, if Pek is hobbled and struggling, maybe we don't constantly throw the ball into the paint so he can back a guy down and short-arm a little hook shot. And maybe we just don't give Bennett the ball near the 3-point line, because he's a terrible shooter and seems prone to taking a bad shot out there – let's be smarter about where we position him on the court.

I don't think Flip is awful. I just don't see much in terms of maximizing the team's output by bending to the players' skills. That's what frustrates me."

"Payne is too soon to judge fairly. It doesn't look good, but Flip only gave up a lotto protected pick and Payne can still develop into a serviceable back up. Now the Wolves have two back up 4s with room to grow instead of just one, there are worse moves. "
"Definitely not too early.  Payne was the worst player in the NBA last year.  You'd be lucky to get a 2nd rounder for him right now.  Giving up a first for a guy who, at best, could be a backup PF is a bad move."
"Well, AB and AP will have another chance this year, and those are 2 young guys that get a decent chunk of playing time.  G can play the 4 depending on certain matchups, and if we draft Karl Towns then it will be interesting to see if he can play the 4 at the NBA level. 


Point is, don't be worried.  The wolves have options, and are in no rush.  "
"he's got a nice stroke"
"Played hard? The whole ""Klove doesn't play defense"" thing didn't just appear out of thin air"
"Well, he did nearly everything else at an above average level. He certainly has his flaws but I can't fault him for not being good at everything."
"Bennett is still on the roster, Payne will get burn, Hummel will get minutes if the Wolves re-sign him.  KG will get 20 minutes a game until he gets injured. Wolves also have the draft rights to Nemanja Bjelica but it's looking like they're going to trade him to get a second late first rounder.   

The Wolves will just throw bodies at the problem but are unlikely to find a solution to the issue next season.  

Edit: I saw the Bjelica speculation on one of Chad Ford's mock drafts. Zgoda's been saying Bjelica wants the full MLE which may be a complicating factor for Flip to bring him over.  
"
"Unlikely to find a solution?  Seems a bit premature to make that conclusion"
"Bennett is bad, Payne is bad, Hummel is a role player, KG is old. There isn't a solution in that bunch of players. "
"There isn't really a lack of players as much as there is a lack of competent players. Personally I think we should target Bass in FA so he can play minutes with AP off the bench and AB getting some. "
"We'll prolly move either KAT or Okafor once we draft one of them. Can anyone give me an idea on why we traded for Payne and what can he do? "
"I don't get ""unathletic."" Really? What about Shabazz is unathletic?"
"With 5 PF bodies in KG, Payne, Bennett, Dieng and Bjelica possibly on the roster, Shabazz, Hummel and Budinger logging some minutes as small ball PF's and the strong C rotation of Pek, Dieng and KAT/Okafor i think a stable solution will appear."
"Maybe I just missed it, but where was the speculation about Bjelica for a 1st rounder?"
"Uh.... He's a very explosive athlete, great size and length, shot a great 3pt% on college on high volume, and plays extremely hard.

He has a slow release which makes his shooting less valuable in the NBA where defenders are tall enough to contest his shots and seems to have a very low basketball IQ.

Wolves traded for Payne because they had shit all going on for them at the PF position and because Tom Izzo really likes him."
"Welp I really hope he develops in to at least a very good bench player :/"
"Where are you reading that we're going to trade bjelly's rights?"
"Only saying back up as KAT and Pek will presumably be the starters for the next three seasons.

He hasn't looked great, but players have come back from worse starts."
"Flip takes porzingas number 1 overall"
"Name one player who has gone from being the worst player in the league to a quality starter.  One.

""Hasn't looked great"" - understatement of the year, makes me think you haven't seen him play and/or don't know his stats.  Again, giving up a first for Payne looked bad at the time, and now looks downright stupid.  "
"&gt; Wolves also have the draft rights to Nemanja Bjelica but it's looking like they're going to trade him to get a second late first rounder.

I'd be curious to see where you heard that as well.  It'd be extremely short-sighted I fear, I've liked what I've seen out of Bjelica via the scraps you can find online for some time."
"Yeah...  I've pretty much come to grips with the notion that power forward is the least important position in the NBA...  Something will work out, and if it doesn't, we can just find a decent stretch guy who won't kill us in free agency."
"Okafor is not a power forward.  Some people are pegging KAT as one, but he seems like a center to me."
"He's the perfect spark plug off the bench type player."
"I believe the idea is to package Bjelica and the wolves two second rounders to move up into the first round and grab Tyus or Vaughn. "

"getting tyus for those picks/player would be a great deal imo"
"I think it's just speculation based on reports of what Bjelica wants to come over and how the Wolves seem to feel about him (rich man's Robbie Hummel I believe is the quote Doogie used)."
"Vaughn shouldn't be getting taken in the first round..."
"Gerald Green was so bad that he landed overseas for a couple years, came back and is now at least a serviceable player. Spending time in the D-League or China and then coming back to the league is a fairly common thing, Green is just the only player that comes to mind at the moment. 

The fact that he's already 24 isn't great, but he was a lottery pick for a reason and it would be stupid to cross him off entirely so soon. Also, he wasn't the worst player in the league. The worst player in the league was firmly planted on the bench all season. I'd say a good candidate would be Boston's own; Gerald Wallace. "
"Seems like a bit of an overpay for a backup PG to me. I am a fan of Bjelica and think he could be a solid fill in at PF. Not a huge Tyus fan but I understand the appeal. "
"It really comes down to how you feel about Bjelica.  Some people really like him, some people don't.  The main thing I don't like about him is that he's 27, so he's basically reached his peak as a player.  And if what we see now is what we get, I'm not sure he's good enough to be any more than a good player coming off the bench in the NBA.  A rich man's Robbie Hummel, if you will ;)"
"I think he's alright. Under performed at UNLV because UNLV's coach is awful. Better coaching he could be good, though he may be a bad version of Nick Young as a chucker. "
"I remember Flip talking about Bjelly as an asset that could be used in different scenarios, but i'm sure that also means he could play on the team."
"I like him a lot as a point forward, makes smart plays. Poor man's Lamar Odom (peak Lamar that is not bad Lamar) might be a realistic comparison. "
"Played against him, played AAU under his mentor, been around a lot of people who know him well.

Extremely talented player.  I would not be super excited if we drafted him though.  I've heard a lot of stories that throw up red flags left and right..."
"That's disappointing. "
"As a 19 year old rookie, Gerald Green had a PER that was almost DOUBLE that of Payne.  In addition, most of Green's secondary numbers were far superior to Payne's.  Terrible comparison.

Just bc a guy was a lottery pick doesn't mean he's still worth a first rd pick in a trade.  Anthony Bennett went #1 two years ago and nobody would touch him with a ten foot pole now.

Based on PER, Payne was the worst PF in the NBA by a wide margin.  And yes, perhaps Gerald Wallace is worse - BUT NOBODY IS TRADING A FIRST ROUND PICK FOR HIM!!!

For the 3rd time, Payne would maybe fetch a 2nd round pick right now.  The trade looked bad at the time - as noted by many NBA writers like zach lowe.  Do you seriously not understand how this works?  "
"Bennett is done. I half expect a Bennett/Budinger for cap space deal this off season. KG won't get 20 minutes a game anymore; 15 a game for 50 games seems more reasonable.  He's done being a major contributor though.

Dieng has a ways to go, but could get there. Bjelica is a good rebounder/defender in Europe who is a great passing/shooting PF in the NBA (I'd guess 37-38% from 3).  Towns next to Pekovic for 10 minutes a game seems like a good idea.

I have no idea what we will do, but I can see a lot of good options."
"Bjelica, Dieng, and Towns also exist."
"Yeah...  It really is.  I know all of the Big 3 (Jones, Vaughn, Travis).  Rashad is the only one that I've heard stuff like that about.  Haven't even sniffed it with the other two."
"We traded 2 second round picks for him. Unless we make the playoffs then it's a late future 1st round pick.

That's the right value for Payne. Very unlikely we get a better prospect in the future from those picks."
"Pek will not be on this team past this year, let alone starting.."
"Yeah I tried adding some audio clips of people saying bad things about him at the beginning but the song drowned it out. I added the Underdog so it would be like people were doubting him but he exceeded their expectations. Didn't work as I planned. 

Also, nice name. my name is Connor too"

"You're comparing playing-injured Pek to Dieng. Healthy Pek &gt; Dieng &gt; Injured Pek.

And no, Pek will not actually be injured for the rest of his life. Let's see if he's healthy to start the season, and limit his minutes if he is. Pek for 22 minutes a game with Kat/Dieng/KG picking up the rest is fine by me."
"Not convinced Towns and Bjelica are for sure going to be on the roster. Dieng can spot minutes at PF but isn't a full time solution. Wolves throwing bodies at the problem isn't a bad idea it's just not a solution. Wolves can find the long term solution at PF next year in free agency or the draft. "
"Bjelica + picks for Tyus seems reasonable so maybe he's not here. But he's the Euroleague MVP and can rebound, pass, defend, and shoot. Skill wise he's a great fit for us, and he's not just a body to throw at it.

KAT obviously plays C too, but with Pek (21)/Dieng (30)/Towns (31)/KG (14)/Hummel (Injury backup) you have a legit 96 minutes at PF/C without Bjelica. I guess I am hoping we get solid minutes out of Pek and KG while the young guns play starter minutes even if they're off the bench.  And in limited/bench minutes I think both are productive. But who knows.

Edit: and that's assuming Payne 100% flops, which is not a foregone conclusion. I'm kind of hoping he gets burn in the D-League."
"He loves basketball and works very hard on his game. He'll be fine."
"I think Payne and even Bennett still have potential. Don't forget Payne was just a rookie last year he by no means should be counted out at this point. I think KG/Payne/Bennet sharing the minutes would be solid for us next year. We are still a couple years from competing for anything outside of an 8th seed playoff spot so I don't think we need to rush a decision and overpay a vet. "
"Because I prefer a team that is built by selecting players they see as a fit and developing them on their own. There isn't a right or wrong way, but I am allowed to have a preference. "
"I don't care if it ruffles feathers or not but Bazz was playing better bball when he went down than Wiggins was at the end of the season. I'm convinced of it. "
"And by stroke you mean dunk, right? "
"I miss Brewer. "
"I miss you. "
"He also practically forced Adelman to put him in the D-league. "
"Adrien Payne's hot dogging of Jeremy Lin "
"How will you trade him?"
"damn /u/FlyingScissor has been active as hell on the sub the last few days and opinionated. "
"That's Bazz's job. "
"I understand how it works, yes. I just don't agree with the general consensus. ""Zach Lowe says"" isn't like, basketball scripture or something. Dude has been wrong plenty and will be wrong plenty more.

No need to get rip shit dude. 

"
"Just pointing out how ridiculous it is to defend trading a first round pick for one of the worst players in the entire league.  

If one of the worst players can fetch a first round pick, then an average player should be able to get multiple first round picks.  Doesn't make sense.  "
"I don't question his love of basketball or that he works hard."
"No idea, but I'd bet my life savings he's gone before the start of the 2016 season. "
"Tyus and Okafor are great friends, but KAT is actually a far superior fit for Jones' strengths."
"LarryDavidFace.gif

"I wouldn't be totally pissed if we got them both. I think it would ease my acceptance of okafor if tyus was a wolf as well"
"Honestly, this is probably just to sell copies more than anything. I seriously doubt Flip reads the Pioneer Press regularly."
"The Morris twins have actually a closer bond and, well, they play together in the NBA =D"
"We need to cater to Wiggins, not Okafor"
"[deleted]"
"no"
"Maybe a poor man's Bradley Beal though. He can hoop."
"Flip has a good relationship with them actually. He seems to like their guy more than Jerry ""I hate Minnesota basketball this is just my job"" Zgoda."
"no need to rush filling holes.  PF can be solved down the road.  Pretty loaded position."
"I always get a kick out of coming in here, two weeks ago we'd have been perfectly happy with the number 2 pick, now Okafor is literally Hitler and if we draft him the team is doomed"
"I miss you too buddy"
"If we make the playoffs, it won't be because of Payne, and it looks like a first will be too much to give up for him.

If we don't make the playoffs, we didn't make the playoffs. Even if it's the right value, it didnt work out for us. "
"What's new? I feel like I haven't seen you around the vikings sub at all since the season ended. I barely knew you frequented this one. Glad you do. There really aren't a whole lot of familiar names here. "
"PLUS KAT IS GREAT FRIENDS WITH WIGGINS LOL LIKE DONT FUCK THIS UP FLIP"
"I think getting towns and having him develop with Rubio/Wiggins is their best chance at making the playoffs in the coming years."
"I pop in the vikings sub from time to time, i was hanging out more around the draft. Just such a slow off season and if i see another god damn gnome ill lose my shit lol. Wolves sub i frequent but barely ever decent content. Just patiently waiting for the season to start lol. Nfl sub im on a ton, always seeing whats happenin. Whats new with you man?"
"It was AB's 2nd year, and he's still not in game shape.  Payne was a rookie.  Robbie Hummel probably wouldn't be on another NBA roster if  Flip didn't sign him.  KG, don't worry about KG.  I just don't think you can shut the door already on those 2 young guys"
"ok lets call the star and tell them to run a KAT piece"
"AB is bad, it shouldn't take a player 2 years to get in game shape. Payne is 24 years old, he wasn't great in college, was bad in the D-League, and has no idea where he needs to be on the court. Robbie Hummel is better than you give him credit for. KG is 39 and can't play more than 20 minutes in a game.   

There isn't a solution to the PF problem for the Wolves that's on the roster right now. "
